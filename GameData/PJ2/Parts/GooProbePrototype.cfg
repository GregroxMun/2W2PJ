	@description = Due to the high gravity and thin atmosphere of Armstrong, there's a number of difficulties associated with crewed spaceflight, particularly in the case of returning crew back home without smearing them over several hundred miles of tundra at a quarter of orbital velocity. Mission designers and planners at the Space Probe Adiminstration wondered, what if there was a kind of pilot who didn't really care about returning home? And so they turned to the Greater Goo Mass, that lake-sized mass of sentient slime that chills out in the sewers. By training some goobals to fly a spaceship, and then having those individuals briefly rejoin the Greater Goo Mass, the Mass was able to spit out a tank of slime which knew absolutely nothing at all except how to pilot a spacecraft, through animal-like instinct. The PilotingGoo™ Containment Unit is self-contained, and requires no electricity, although it does constantly take in a supply of Syrup, which it is able to replenish by being exposed to sufficiently intense starlight.\n\nThe PilotingGoo™ is not a scientific experiment. Do not attempt to expose it to the space environment; you'll void the warranty and kill the life form.

	@description = The Greater Goo Mass, that enormous volume of sentient shapeshifting slime we owe so much to, has done it again! This formulation of animal instincts and sugar was designed to allow the Space Probe Administration to understand the habitability of alien worlds. It is able to adapt its biochemistry and physical structure to survive and thrive in a variety of conditions, but it's built to be happiest in a Kerbin-like atmospheric pressure, temperature, and composition--assuming, that is, that our records of what Kerbin's atmosphere was like are accurate. Though the MysteryGoo™ is able to survive in conditions that would kill most Kerbals and kerbaloid aliens, by studying how it reacts and what it does to stay alive, we can still understand just what it is that would kill a crew member exposed to a similar environment.\n\n MysteryGoo™ is sentient of course, in that it has senses; but it's not sapient. Rest assured that an independant panel of ethicists has absolved the Space Program, its employees, and all astronauts of any moral responsibility for whatever happens to this containment unit and the contents therein.

	@description = "What would happen if you left some mystery goo sitting around in the weird radiation and/or atmosphere of some faraway planet?" thought The Greater Goo Mass, one day. Now you can find out, thanks to a special longer lastering formulation of MysteryGoo™.\n\nNote: Please allow trained Scientists to deploy for best results.\nAlso Note: Please do not return to Armstrong. Ever! <color=orange>Needs a deployed power unit & central station to operate.</color>
