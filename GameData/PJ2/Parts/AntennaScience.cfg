			Values
			{
				SrfLandedLaunchPad = You have completed a successful test of the spacecraft's communications systems. However, mission control, having just called itself, is beginning to experience an audio feedback loop, and CapCom's cough has just been magnified into an ear-piercing scream. You cut the channel before everyone's hearing is damaged permanently.
				SrfLandedKSC = You have completed a successful test of the spacecraft's communications systems. However, mission control, having just called itself, is beginning to experience an audio feedback loop, and CapCom's cough has just been magnified into an ear-piercing scream. You cut the channel before everyone's hearing is damaged permanently.
				
				SrfLandedSteppe = Hailing frequencies opened. A pharmacy at the nearest settlement picks up its telephone and answers. You explain that you have dialed the wrong number.
				SrfLandedSnow = Hailing frequencies opened. The radio of some hikers a few kilometers away crackles, and they respond. You chat about their adventures and misadventures, and they promise to make a visit Starfleet's Space Program Headquarters visitor center at some point.
				SrfSplashed = Hailing frequencies opened. Starfleet Navy demands to know why you are occupying a maritime channel. You explain that you're calling in from the Space Program, which uses a common frequency. They scold you for "playing pretend at being a mariner."
				
				SrfLandedScorchedSeabed = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedLowlands = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedHighlands = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedContinents = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedMountains = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedRifts = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedContinentalRift = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedVolcanicHotspot = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedBasins = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedCraters = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
