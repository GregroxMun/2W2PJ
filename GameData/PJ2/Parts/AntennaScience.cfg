	RESULTS
	{
		default = Opened hailing frequencies. No response. You remind yourself that a null result is still a valid scientific result.
		KiallaInSpace = While you got no response to your hailing frequencies, you are reading a weak distress signal from somewhere in this planetary system! It's too faint at this distance to localize it or to read what it says, but it is on an ancient Kerbal Interstellar Space Program distress channel!
		TwilightInSpace = ...ert! USS Twilight in severe distress. Requesting assistance from any nearby vessels. 
USS Twilight computer: This has been repetition two billion, three hundred seventy-three million, five hundred ninety-five. Message repeats. Red al...
		TwilightSrfLanded = A burst of data is suddenly transmitted to your ship's antenna. It's in the ancient Kerbin language: KEY = "CYLINDER"\n Y304 D33\n\nUTC 03:25:00 - Liftoff\n\nUTC 03:26:06 - Booster Separation\n\nUTC 03:29:44 - Main Engine Cutoff\n\nUTC 03:29:49 - First Stage Separation\n\nUTC 03:30:01 - Second Stage Ignition\n\nUTC 03:35:08 - Second Stage Engine Cutoff\n\nUTC 03:38:47 - Beginning Approach to USS Twilight\n\nUTC 03:59:13 - Final Approach\n\nUTC 04:04:56 - Docking Sequence Complete\n\nUTC 11:17:45 - Main Engine Ignition\n\nUTC 14:53:11 - Main Engine Cutoff\n\nUTC 14:54:01 - Beginning Hull Spin-up\n\nUTC 14:55:54 - 0.25G\n\nUTC 14:57:19 - 0.5G\n\nUTC 14:58:52 - 0.75G\n\nUTC 14:59:33 - Hull Spin-up Complete\n\nUTC 17:11:38 - Exiting Sphere of Influence\n\nY304 D57\n\nUTC 09:59:30 - Power Low\n\nUTC 09:59:47 - Changing Power Source\n\nY306 D214\n\nUTC 01:07:29 - Exiting Sphere of Influence\n\nY342 D114\n\nUTC 00:36:27 - Entering Sphere of Influence\n\nY342 D124\n\nUTC 17:44:04 - Entering Sphere of Influence\n\nUTC 17:44:57 - Entering Sphere of Influence\n\nUTC 17:44:58 - Hull Breach
		Body

			name = PJ2/Armstrong
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You listen to the combined radio chatter of an entire planet, before deciding to open hailing frequencies to try and talk to someone, anyone. You say 'hello,' but then you hear a loud horn and a shout. You check which channel you have tuned into. It's the Great Armstrong Railway's internal radio system. Oops. It seems like you have accidentally spooked a railway engineer. You hope you haven't caused an accident.
				
				SrfLandedLaunchPad = You have completed a successful test of the spacecraft's communications systems. However, mission control, having just called itself, is beginning to experience an audio feedback loop, and CapCom's cough has just been magnified into an ear-piercing scream. You cut the channel before everyone's hearing is damaged permanently.
				SrfLandedKSC = You have completed a successful test of the spacecraft's communications systems. However, mission control, having just called itself, is beginning to experience an audio feedback loop, and CapCom's cough has just been magnified into an ear-piercing scream. You cut the channel before everyone's hearing is damaged permanently.
				
				SrfLandedSteppe = Hailing frequencies opened. A pharmacy at the nearest settlement picks up its telephone and answers. You explain that you have dialed the wrong number.
				SrfLandedSnow = Hailing frequencies opened. The radio of some hikers a few kilometers away crackles, and they respond. You chat about their adventures and misadventures, and they promise to make a visit Starfleet's Space Program Headquarters visitor center at some point.
				SrfSplashed = Hailing frequencies opened. Starfleet Navy demands to know why you are occupying a maritime channel. You explain that you're calling in from the Space Program, which uses a common frequency. They scold you for "playing pretend at being a mariner."
				
				SrfLandedScorchedSeabed = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedLowlands = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedHighlands = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedContinents = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedMountains = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedRifts = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedContinentalRift = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedVolcanicHotspot = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedBasins = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.
				SrfLandedScorchedCraters = You're unlikely to get a response any time soon, you'll just have to wait for the recovery crews to arrive.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Buzz
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You open hailing frequencies, as a lark. Remarkably, you can pick up a faint repeating signal, coming from somewhere on Buzz!
				SrfLandedSignal = You open hailing frequencies. You get a response: "I'm stuck down here. Can someone help me out? I'm stuck down here in the center. I'm covered in rubble and cement all around me. Can someone help me out?" This spooks you severely, until you realize this is probably just some elaborate prank, and someone on Armstrong is bouncing a radio signal off of the surface of Buzz. You respond, "very funny," sincerely hoping that you're right.
