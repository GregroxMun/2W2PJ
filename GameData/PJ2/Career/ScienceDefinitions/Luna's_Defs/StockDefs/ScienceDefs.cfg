				SrfLandedSteppe = You might be concerned that exhaust or superheated hull plates on your ship could start a fire, but Armstrong doesn't have that much oxygen, so the worst you have to worry about is a sedate and easily prevented smoulder.
				SrfSplashedSteppe = I swear to gods. You're playing pretend at being a boat. This is ridiculous. I swear to gods, God, assorted deities, wormhole aliens, creators, planet modders (whatever THAT is): I hate you. I'm gonna say this ONE MORE TIME okay? This is not a boat game, and you are not a sailboat captain.
				SrfLandedGlacialContinents = On some planets, the continents are the most livable parts, not the least livable. But we're on Armstrong, aren't we? At least you live on a world where the long term stability of the glaciers is garuanteed.
				SrfLandedFrozenRifts = This is a rather dramatic structure you find yourself perched on. They should have given you a better window.
				SrfLandedColdMountains = The rugged terrain here is kind of scary. Cliffs are scary.
				SrfLandedCoolCraters = The textbooks say there shouldn't be craters on atmospheric worlds due to a variety of erosional processes, and yet, here you are. The only possible conclusion you can draw is that Armstrong lacks an atmosphere.

You know the history, and how long it took before anyone came back from the margins of the world, and yet you also know now WHY that is, and you know that you're in a much more modern vessel capable of protecting you from the heat and dust.

Clearly, despite the distance to the suns, you have been struck by snow blindness. That's what you get for listening to the demands of a disembodied science report narrator. You have learned your lesson.

Perhaps it is here, where the crust has been most weakened by impacts, that volcanoes preferentially form? The only question that remains--are these volcanoes active or not?

				SrfLandedFrozenRifts = The surface is cold and icy. If only you could penetrate deep enough to access the crust composition in this region, it would provide valuable insights to how 
				SrfLandedColdMountains = The mountains are so high up in the atmosphere that precipitation hasn't reached it in millions of years, and any ice that had been there has sublimated off of it. As a result, the mountains are bare rock, and are some of the only places where you can access the composition of the continental crust on this side of the planet.

				SrfLandedSnow = You scoop up a ball of snow, and throw it. It's an annoying dry snow that doesn't pack together nicely, so it sorta explodes into a puff of ice that makes an unimpressive mound in the ground you threw it into. You scoop up a second ball of snow and put it in your sample container.
