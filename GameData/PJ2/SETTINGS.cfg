	IntensityCurves = SabineLogarithmic1.5
	
	//Options are Default, InverseLinear, InverseSquare, SabineLogarithmic1.0, and SabineLogarithmic1.5
	//Default uses an exponent of -0.25 for distances greater than sqrt[Lsol] kAU and -0.4 for distances closer than that.
	//result is a very gentle decrease in luminosity for more distant objects, but distant stars may appear too bright in one another's skies.
	//InverseSquare uses an exponent of -2, which is scientifically correct but super duper incompatible with rendering colors on a screen for human vision.
	//InverseLinear uses an exponent of -1, which can be justified after a fashion--the way colors are stored in a computer is by storing the square root, and then squaring it back when displaying it. Squaring an inverse square gives an inverse linear function. Idk.
	//SabineLogarithmic uses Sabine's logarithmic based light curves for more natural illumination that takes into account how our eyes work.
	//SabineLogarithmic1.0 and 1.5 differ by which exponent was used in the light curve generator spreadsheet.
	//the higher exponent represents a greater difference in brightness with distance.
