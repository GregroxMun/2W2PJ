			description = The center of mass of the Suns, Ilio Phosphol and Ilio Vespol, and effectively the center of the entire planetary system. The two suns have a combined mass of 2 Solar masses and shines with the combined intensity of 2 Solar luminosities, though no one seems to remember what exactly a "Sol" is. The Ilio system is thought to be about 4-6 Billion years; astronomers still debate the specific chronology, and was formed through a complex process involving the collapse of what must have been an especially metal-rich molecular cloud.\nThe two stars making up Ilio were not always granted different names--their names, which translate as the Dawn and Dusk Suns, were first used when astronomers began to investigate early theories of planetary motion. \n\n<color=#19bdbd>-Luna Gregoria</color>
