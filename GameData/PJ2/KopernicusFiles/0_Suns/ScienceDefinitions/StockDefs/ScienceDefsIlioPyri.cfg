				InSpaceHigh = Measured gravitational field environment around Pyri. System-wide, the most massive planet is Bifröst, and in fact Pyri is in a binary orbit about it--but at such a distance it is easy to abstract that away. The barycenter isn't THAT far out, after all. And you know how finnicky barycentric measurement systems can be!
				InSpaceLow = The sensor maps out mass concentrations, finding very little to report. Higher order interpretations of results reveal the layered structure of Pyri. It seems likely that the convective zone of the star reaches all the way into the star's center, recycling hydrogen in the fusion core. If true, that would imply Pyri could last until the edge of eternity.
