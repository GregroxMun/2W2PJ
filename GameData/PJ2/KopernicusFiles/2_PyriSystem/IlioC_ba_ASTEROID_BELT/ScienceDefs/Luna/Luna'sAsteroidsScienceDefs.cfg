	@RESULTS
	{
		WeegletossInSpace = Weegletoss appears as a pile of gravel and rubble clinging together under some crude parody of gravity. You worry that if you tried to land, you'd just sink in.
		WeegletossSrfLandedDustyEquator = There is truly not a lot keeping your ship from sinking into the dirt, here.
		WeegletossSrfLanded = With your ship set down in amongst the boulders and pebbles and dirt, the "ground" such as it is barely preventing you from sinking in, you wonder what else could be buried here. What lost secrets could be found inside this tiny little world? Perhaps undiscovered sorts of candy, lost change, assorted trinkets, or a piece of hay or a needle.
		WeegletossDarkBoulder = Why's this one boulder so much darker than all the others?
		WeegletossRubblePile = Weegletoss is a type of asteroid known as a "Rubble Pile," meaning that it is a collection of loose rocks and boulders held together by gravity and static forces. But this rubble pile seems to have a rubble pile *on* it--as in, a piled up heap of slightly different boulders and dust. Bizarre...

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]:FOR[PJ2]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		WeegletossSrfLanded = Weegletoss is a stony rubble pile with a small amount of volatile ices sequestered deep beneath the surface. It is composed of largely very similar kinds of rock--which is unexpected for an object composed of lots of impactors.
		WeegletossSrfLandedRubblePile = The rubble pile on the rubble pile is extremely dry, in contrast to other parts of the asteroid. This could be an entire moon that dropped out of Weegletoss's skies.
		WeegletossSrfLandedDarkBoulder = This one particular boulder is especially carbon-rich--it didn't come from whatever object formed Weegletoss, it had to have come from elsewhere. It also has a higher concentration of volatile ices than expected.

		Weegletoss = Get weegled.
		WeegletossSrfLandedSmallCraters = These minor depressions are so slight you can barely tell they're depressions at all--but they seem to be extremely subtle remnants of old impacts... everything sorta ends up smoothed over on these things.
		WeegletossSouthBasin = This "basin" (though by the standards of any other world it'd be a mere minor depression) seems to have a smoother surface than other parts of Weegletoss, except for the largest of boulders in the area.
		WeegletossNorthBasin = This "basin" (though by the standards of any other world it'd be a mere minor depression) seems to have a smoother surface than other parts of Weegletoss, except for the largest of boulders in the area.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]:FOR[PJ2]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		Weegletoss = Weegletoss is (relatively) temperate, due to its non-locked rotation it gets even illumination on all sides, so while it gets hot during the Pyri-facing day and cold at night or during a Ilio-facing day, it never truly gets scorched.

		Weegletoss = The mystery goo has gotten monumentally weegled.
		WeegletossSrfLanded = The mystery goo can't handle these weegle levels and has disappeared entirely. WE CAN NOT FIND IT. Send help.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]:FOR[PJ2]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		Weegletoss = The gravioli map shows that Weegletoss is essentially one homogenous mass of stuff, with some cavities and voids inside and one particularly large 50-meter boulder stuffed somewhere inside.
		WeegletossRubblePile = The mound of stuff has a slightly higher density than expected, implying there is a single large chunk of rock at its center, like the core of a small tiny little baby moon.
