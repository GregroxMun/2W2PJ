				SrfLandedPuzzle = A wise man once said that Deja Vu is just remembering in the wrong direction. Regardless of which direction the feeling goes, it hits you for some reason.
				SrfLandedImpact = You adjust your seating a little bit, in the microgee environment, even the relatively gentle landing was enough to move you out of your perfectly snug seating position.
				SrfLandedRifts = A successful landing on the surface of Naharosmank is nothing compared to the feeling of breathing manually, try it out!

				InSpaceHigh = Mission control has to remind you which direction to look as you quickly come speeding in towards Welkendon. Turns out you were looking at Armstrong by mistake, looking in the right direction gives you quite a start. Turns out, even the smallest worlds are still world-sized.
				InSpaceLow = You can't help but compare the shape of Welkendon to various things, the overbite of some large mammal, the shovel of an article of industrial machinery, perhaps even a duck. The duck comparison sticks a bit better, it's a comforting thought.
				SrfLandedImpact = A realization hits you! And then you lose it. Hitting... something to do with hitting, punching? No, no- something about, slamming... something... against... gahh. Forget it.
				SrfLandedRifts = A successful landing on the surface of Welkendon is nothing compared to the feeling of adjusting the position of your tongue so it's more comfortable, try it out!
				SrfLandedTwinPeaks = You make a comment about twin suns rising over twin peaks... what you thought was a profound message to the folks back home devolves into a heated debate over the member stars of the Ilio System, and whether "twin suns" or "triple suns" is more proper. You can't get a word in to defend yourself.
				SrfLandedNorthValley = The appearance of the cliffaces even from within your spacecraft is mildly intimdating. How did such a structure form on a world that, by your understanding, shouldn't have any real inherent geological engines shaping its surface?
				SrfLandedGeneric = You take a glance over the mission sequence, and prepare yourself to get to the bottom of Welkendon's geologic puzzles.

				InSpaceLow = Looking out at the rounded horizon, mountains and valleys scrolling below your craft, you almost wonder if Schmev should be a fully recognized planet.
				SrfLandedLow = Schmev is rather forgiving in terms of the stress of pulling off a landing, though the orbit-to-surface journey is still the hardest of its kind the Arriprit Belt offers.
				SrfLandedHigh = It's a wonderful day to be a Schmevstronaut. Mission control alerts you quickly that Schmevstronaut is not a real job, but you're still a space explorer which is broader and cooler. You grumble as you loudly ruffle the mission schedule in your hands so the people back home hear it.
				SrfLandedBurn = It's getting toasty, not to a dangerous extent, but it's so uncomfortable you keep checking the internal temperature readout. And this is with Schmev's surface absorbing more heat than it bounces back onto your ship.
				SrfLandedTerminator = You can't help but feel as though you're about to stumble on some big cosmic answers. You ask mission control to flip a coin. It's heads. Maybe it's your lucky day?
				SrfLandedFar = You get a hunch you might get some major valuable insights about Schmev Lore. Goodness, you love Schmev Lore.
				SrfLandedBelt = The surface below the ground has a slightly slick quality to it. Was that in your head? Who is out here paving Schmev?
				SrfLandedSalt = The surface is somewhat grainy, and doesn't respond super well to the weight of the vehicle. You really hope this is safe.
				SrfLandedRifts = If you didn't know any better, you almost feel like you could mistake the shapes on the horizon for the visage of far off continental crust on Armstrong. Mission Control says that's incredibly silly, like really silly. How on Earth do you see that? Yeah the shapes are there, but there's no air, no snow, hell even on the ground you can see how much smaller Schmev is than Armstrong. Hell you can see Armstrong, it's in the sky here. Silly. Incredibly silly of you.

				SrfLandedPuzzle = You take detailed observations of the shapes and forms of this strange region. You hope the exact mechanisms that created it might some day be understood. The scientist talking to you back home says he'll let you know how the story develops.
				SrfLandedImpact = You strike a cool pose that makes it look like you landed like a superkerbal and created this entire basin. Even in the middle of space, and with it not on the records, you find yourself slightly embarrassed.
				SrfLandedSouthValley = You bet you could jump higher than the walls of this canyon. Mission Control informs you it's not a canyon.

				InSpaceHigh = Welkendon's jagged form seems an inviting prospect for exploration as it looms below. You're able to make out several candidate landing sites of visual intrigue, with the fuel budget so high and orbital velocities so low, why not go to all of them?
				InSpaceLow = Floating alongside Welkendon reminds you of those daredevils backhome who go swimming with glaciers. Luckily, Welkendon is at no risk of completely changing its orientation and killing you while you're distracted... right?
				SrfLandedGeneric = This is absolutely a stony asteroid. There's not the faintest inclination that metallic materials exist here. Every time you think you spot something reflective it turns out to be a distant planet or star just above the horizon.
				SrfLandedImpact = You take note that with the scale of some of these craters, it's likely that the Arriprit Belt was once far denser in terms of large asteroids. You then recall the large impact basins Armstrong hosts. You wonder if there were indisputably planet-sized objects here once.
				SrfLandedRifts = It's like a hallway, made of rock, and without a roof. You note that the edges of the rift seem to have landslides streaking down their sides, you almost missed them.
				SrfLandedTwinPeaks = From the surface, these two mounds are hard to visually distinguish from the rest of Welkendon, although you do notice your bootprints are exposing rocks with little shiny speckles on them.
				SrfLandedNorthValley = Some of the boulders are arranged in strange ways here, bunched up along the sides of the valley, stacked and huddled together. It's not quite a random distribution, it's like someone swiped away the floor beneath them.

You notice many large impact basins, though their white ejecta rings seem to disappear at the point directly below Pyri. Perhaps ejecta gets burned away, or otherwise darkened, by Pyri's light?
				InSpaceLow = Everytime you pass over the strange belt-like structure you can't help but see it as a river. It's not a river, absolutely it's not, but it does remind you of one. A big dark river of rock.
				SrfLandedLow = Schmev's surface gravity is considerably better at holding you down than the other objects in this belt. That's not really saying much.
				SrfLandedHigh = Schmev's surface gravity is considerably better at holding you down than the other objects in this belt. That's not really saying much.
				SrfLandedBurn = You keep your sunsvisor down, and even your head down. Pyri is really bright, and it's interrupting your workflow.
				SrfLandedTerminator = The concentric mountains of this basin almost resemble a city, neatly organized mound-buildings like those at home on Armstrong, and some grooves for walking between them. You imagine there could be conspiracies about that.
				SrfLandedFar = The concentric mountains of this basin almost resemble a city, but the castle-like shape of the bright mountains on the southern extent make it look like a kingdom instead.
				SrfLandedSalt = You have a hunch you know what this is. Mission control urges you not to eat it.
				SrfLandedBelt = It's like a road, you imagine yourself walking all the way around Schmev, it's a small world afterall, how hard could it be? Mission control informs you: very.
				SrfLandedRifts = Schmev has a host of geologic oddities on its surface, you can't help but wonder if it was once a more active world, now effectively fossilized.

				SrfLandedCollar = If you didn't know, you wouldn't be able to tell Gershmurzelen had such a dramatic shape from here. Although these ridges almost seem more interesting than the bilobate nature of Gershmurzelen.
				SrfLandedGersh = This sounds like a made up word, doesn't it? Like, some old language might have "Gershmurzelen" as a word, maybe some small village. And what was the deal with the bacon again? You begin taking notes on the structure of the terrain around you while your head continues to spin on the odd briefing you recieved about this world before accepting the mission.
				SrfLandedMurzelen = Welcome to Gersh! The east... wait no this is the west lobe, Murzelen, this is Murzelen. Welcome to Murzelen! Huh, for being two different asteroids, Gersh and Murzelen look remarkably similar at a glance don't they?

				SrfLandedHigh = Schmev is a carbonaeous dwarf planet, with black soot-like dust covering its entire surface. It's actually staining your spacesuit pretty bad, and it's hard to rub off. Perhaps the dust is magnetic.
				SrfLandedTerminator = You pick up a flattened rock from the surface of Daybreak Crater. This sample near exactly matches the expectations, this crater is without a doubt the exact origin of the SCH-Series Meteorites. In fact, this is likely the origin point of the entire Schmev Impact Family... Rider, Raft and Gershmurzelen were born here eons ago. Thinking that over is a strange feeling.
				SrfLandedFar = Some outlying members of the SCH-Series Meteroite Family align closely with the samples collected from this impact basin. It's strange to say it, but a fair bit of Schmev Samples are already waiting back home on Armstrong.
				SrfLandedSalt = Salt. Not the kind you'd want to stick your finger into and taste with your mouth, it's not the fun salt. It's salt though, sodium carbonate. The existence of this brine implies that in the distant past Schmev may have had an internal source of water, potentially, or it was delivered from elsewhere.

				SrfLandedBurn = The goo doesn't tolerate the tempartures here very well, and enters hibernation quickly, it's unclear if it'll come back out.
				SrfLandedFar = The goo has gained a wonderful view of the stars, but doesn't appreciate it as it's freezing cold. The cold temperatures make it difficult for the goo to shed water and form a cyst, but it manages to do so, now encased in a ball of ice.

			{
				InSpaceHigh = The goo is enthralled by this world, it almost seems to mimick Gershmurzelen's rotation.
				InSpaceLow = The goo is enthralled by this world, it almost seems to mimick Gershmurzelen's rotation.
				SrfLandedCollar = Given water and nutrient injections, the goo seems to be able to actually regulate its temperature well on as Gershmurzelen rotates, creating periods of heating and cooling. Or at least, it almost does well. It doesn't take long for the goo to give up and enter hiberation.
				SrfLandedGersh = The goo thinks Gersh is the better lobe, that's its real opinion, for sure.
				SrfLandedMurzelen = The goo thinks Murzelen is the better lobe. I'm serious! It told me. Mhm!
