			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Garner's lumpy dumpy surface is rather intimating to fly over, you half expect to find yourself facing down an approaching mountain and needing to pull off an evasive maneuver.
				InSpaceHigh = The distinct coloration between Garner's Antipyrian and Synpyrian Hemispheres is very obvious from a high orbital vantage point. One wonders why the teal regions are so shy of Pyri, or if the individual sides are truly as distinct as they seem.

				SrfLandedFlat = The flats of Garner make for very safe landing locations, they may provide apt staging grounds for more complex operations on the surface of Garner. You almost feel as though the sky itself glows a slight teal, but it's probably just reflections on your windows.
				SrfLandedNorthFlat = The flats of Garner make for very safe landing locations, they may provide apt staging grounds for more complex operations on the surface of Garner. You almost feel as though the sky itself glows a slight teal, but it's probably just reflections on your windows.
				SrfLandedNSouthFlat = The flats of Garner make for very safe landing locations, they may provide apt staging grounds for more complex operations on the surface of Garner. You almost feel as though the sky itself glows a slight teal, but it's probably just reflections on your windows.

				//Antipyrian
				SrfLandedAHighlands = It's rugged, but it seems steady enough. There's no idication of the craft sliping or the surface collapsing under the craft's weight.
				SrfLandedALowlands = You gaze out at the blue-green terrain surrounding the craft, you note how dark it can get, even with the brightish teal hues on all sides. Ilio's light almost makes Garner's surface shimer.

				SrfLandedHighlands = Landing on Garner is fairly forgiving, but it remains one of the larger minor bodies in the Pyri System. If you can land here, you've got what it takes to land on... pretty much any other dwarf planet or asteroid!
				SrfLandedLowlands = You gaze out at the tan and brown boulders and ground surrounding the craft, you note how bright it is even with the dark terrain. Pyro's light overwhelms even the darkest regolith.

				SrfLandedCrater = You are in a crater, mission control informs you. You take this information to heart.
				SrfLandedPolarCrater = You are in a crater, and the effort to get to this one was notably harder.

				SrfLandedSlopes = You are only slightly nervous about operating the craft at this location. Only very slightly, you promise mission reports.

			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You barely noticed you had entered Morhomlo's sphere of influence, you quickly catch a glance at the large dwarf planet out the window. It's bigger than you expected.
				InSpaceLow = You double check your trajectory, best not contribute another pockmark to Morhomlo's surface now.

				SrfLandedPyriHigh = On some worlds mountains would be considered more dangerous landing spots, however the highlands on Morhomlo are remarkably smooth.
				SrfLandedPyriMid = The craft made a strange crunching sound against the surface, perhaps the surface material below the craft compressess easily.
				SrfLandedPyriLow = Morhomlo's subpyrian terrain has an invitingly diverse range of features, they would be very fun to fly past.
			
				SrfLandedHollows = On some worlds low-lying flat regions would be considered some of the safest options for a landing site, but Morhomlo shakes it up a bit. Its hollows are rather small targets, and can be surrounded by intimdating terrain forms. Of course, low gravity doesn't make it all that challenging in the end.

				SrfLandedOtherside = Another happy landing, Morhomlo calls for you to have a relaxing walk about and stretch your legs. Depending on the mission, you might still have a ways to go, so you best take advantage of the rest.
				SrfLanded = Another happy landing, Morhomlo calls for you to have a relaxing walk about and stretch your legs. Depending on the mission, you might still have a ways to go, so you best take advantage of the rest.
				SrfLandedOtherside = You make a joke about your landing setting off Morhomlo's volcanoes. Mission Control makes no comment on this possibility, and you find that concerning.

				SrfLandedCraters = You make a joke about how lucky you are that you didn't add any more craters to Morhomlo. Mission Control is upset by the remark.

			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Looking around at the surrounding terrain reminds you slightly of old stories about "planes" and "flying," you remember people probably didn't participate in those activities without being within a vehicle, well, with some exceptions.
				InSpaceHigh = You take a glance at Garner, and comment that finding a safe landing site may be a concern. Mission Control doesn't take this as a joke, and begins asking questions, fearing you may have identified a previously-unknown and hazardous aspect of Garner.

				SrfLandedFlat = You kneel down, as best you can, and clear the dust aside with your palm. You take your fist and knock against the exposed solid surface. It'll be difficult to sample this.
				SrfLandedNorthFlat = You kneel down, as best you can, and clear the dust aside with your palm. You take your fist and knock against the exposed solid surface. It'll be difficult to sample this.
				SrfLandedNSouthFlat = You kneel down, as best you can, and clear the dust aside with your palm. You take your fist and knock against the exposed solid surface. It'll be difficult to sample this.

				//Antipyrian
				SrfLandedHighlands = You gaze at the sky, trying to spot one of the resident asteroids of the innermost Pyri System. You look very, very carefully.
				SrfLandedLowlands = Setting EVA suit cooling systems to maximum, it's a very sunny... always on this part of Garner.

				SrfLandedAHighlands = You gaze at the sky, and then immediently level your head again after catching an accidental glance at Pyri. Even with the visor down, that hurt.
				SrfLandedALowlands = Setting EVA suit heating systems to maximum, it's very chilly night on Garner, and day isn't much better.


				SrfLandedCrater = You can't seem to find good footing, the crater floor is slick and devoid of dust that would at least provide some amount of traction.
				SrfLandedPolarCrater = You can't help but realize the scale and positioning of these impact basins implies there were several other significantly sized bodies in the primordial Pyri System on higher inclinations. You wonder, were these formed as part of the Pyri System flattening out into a rough disk? Perhaps Armstrong also has impact basins near its poles.

				SrfLandedSlopes = There are some visual indications of landslides in these regions, likely caused by sublimation. You find yourself briefly imagining what Garner would look like with oceans, despite that obviously not being what happened here... right?

		{
			name = PJ2/Ast_Morhomlo //Morhomlo
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The EVA operation runs smoothly with Morhomlo's ever helpful and watchful gaze on the craft. What a lucky stone!
				InSpaceLow = You try to make a game out of counting Morhomlo's craters, only to find yourself getting slightly dizzy after counting 23.

				SrfLandedPyriHigh = You feel as though you're standing on top of the world, depending on who you ask you are. To others Morhomlo itself may be very far from the top, in fact very deep within a massive well with Pyri in the center. You've got a lot of climbing yet to do, but you're halfway there.
				SrfLandedPyriMid = You take a moment to watch your step and steady yourself, the ground feels less steady than you had hoped.
				SrfLandedPyriLow = The horizon line is far from a line here.

				SrfLandedHollows = The mountains reaching up above the walls of the hollow makes you feel very, very small. Almost like you're standing in the middle of a... what were they called... forest. A forest of stone. You wonder if anyone back home is old enough to have seen a forest, and can corroborate your comparison.
				
				SrfLandedOtherside = There are some volatiles in the crust here, with proper planning Morhomlo may indeed work well as a destination for fuel production operations.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = The volcanoes have a distinct form to them even from the surface, however the accumulation of interplanetary dust suggests not much has happened in the last many billions of years of Morhomlo's life. It's a little sad and a little eerie to think about.
				SrfLandedCollapsed = You suddenly feel as if you are trespassing upon something not meant to be disturbed, a place of ancient and dramatic history, far older than Kerbalkind... and you are. It's probably not actually scary though.
				SrfLandedCraters = You take a moment to note how deep the bowl is, and how many craters have since formed on top of this one. Law of stratification tells us that this impact basin is ancient, very ancient.
				SrfLandedLeadingStain = The off-green color here is an interesting splash of color, but it's not exactly as vibrant as some of the major planets you can see in the sky. Hopefully Morhomlo will help you reach them.

	{
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Garner //Garner
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedFlat = Removing a sample of the dust is easy, but you struggle for a few moments to crack the underlying surface. You end up with a crumbled mess of glassy rocks, but a sample is a sample. There was likely a time when these flats glowed with lava, before they solidified into glass flats.
				SrfLandedNorthFlat = You meticulously remove a rather large slab of volcanic glass from the surface, and make a comment that it could make a nice countertop. This sample will go a long way in determining the volcanic history of Garner. The existence of the antipyrian glass flats alone suggests it was a very dramatic period.
				SrfLandedNSouthFlat = You find an are where the glassy surface has fractured, and manage to remove a naturally cut chunk from the surface with help from your tools. Determining what caused the glass flat to crack, and when, may reveal the age of flats by comparing to the expected rate of expansion due to cooling.

				//Antipyrian
				SrfLandedHighlands = There are many pebbles and dust here, it's like a candy store of various geologic clues. You shovel as many different stones as you can into a baggie. Some are volcanic, some are silicate, and some are impact ejecta. Many things to learn.
				SrfLandedLowlands = There are some extremely trace amounts of ice and other volatiles among the regolith and dust, certainly delivered by impacts from the outer system. Though the extreme scarcity of volatiles demonstrates the difficulty small icy meteors have in entering the inner system.

				SrfLandedAHighlands = The rubbly highlands are mainly rocky material, with fairly little dust. It's likely any fine powder gets blown away by Pyri.
				SrfLandedALowlands = There are lots of igenous materials to sample here. Despite a lot of the evidence of Garner's volcanic processes that defined the nature of the Antipyrian Hemisphere being lost to time, the rocks themselves still hold pages of the story. Seems Garner's volcanism was definitively global.

				SrfLandedCrater = The glassy surface of this crater almost mirrors that of the flats, however this crater floor is impact melt, and unlikely to be otherwise volcanic. In fact large impacts like this were probably responsible for Garner losing heat faster.
				SrfLandedPolarCrater = You pick up a piece of impact brecca and notice a unit within it is a distinct red-ish color, setting it apart from the rest of the sample. Later analysis will find this is the piece of the planetoid that made this basin. A glimpse into a world now entirely lost. Or, perhaps, not entirely.

				SrfLandedSlopes = The dust seems to make fine downhill-travelling lanes where previous landslides have occured. These may have been sparked by Garnerquakes.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Ast_Morhomlo //Morhomlo
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedPyriHigh = Silicate deposits dominate this relatively smooth region of the Morhomlan surface, and taking a core sample surprisingly reveals very trace amounts of ice deeper down. The formation of hollows likely isn't over yet on Morhomlow, and likely won't be for many millions of years to come.
				SrfLandedPyriMid = There is a lot of gravel here, which means sizable samples are able to be easily collected without aid from tools, how convenient!
				SrfLandedPyriLow = Morhomlo is very stony overall, but there are some metallic samples among the many boulders here.

				SrfLandedHollows = These sandy pits are extremely dry, and likely formed as volatiles were sublimated by Pyri. The insane concentration of these features implies Morhomlo once had quite a lot of ices in its crust, and likely still does in shadowed regions.
				
				SrfLandedOtherside = There are some volatiles in the crust here, with proper planning Morhomlo may indeed work well as a destination for fuel production operations.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = These lava flows are too fresh for Morhomlo to be entirely dead, yet everything else about Morhomlo says it's long cooled off. Perhaps Morhomlo does experience very occasional eruptive events? You pick up a sample and hope the results of studies to come are an interesting read.
				SrfLandedCollapsed = There are not many regonizable ingenous rocks in the area, however thsi area shows evidence of being volcanic in its history. Perhaps period heating and cooling from Ilio has slowly broken up any such rocks into unrecognizable sand. This implies this volcano is extraoridnarily ancient, and that not much has occured in this region since its extinction.
				SrfLandedCraters = There is considerable compression of the surface materials here, you're able to easily sample lower layers of Morhomlo's surface, and find the concentration of metallic deposits increases noticably after not much depth. Perhaps the crust is not fully differentiated for this to happen so quickly.
				SrfLandedLeadingStain = These material deposits contain a lot of metallic material, and has accumluated slowly as Morhomlo travels around Pyri. Perhaps a pair of small metallic asteroids annihilated each other near Morhomlo's orbit.

				SrfLandedLowlands = Garner feels the heat of Pyri pretty hard on the Synpyrian Hemisphere, recieving just as much heat as Armstrong does.
