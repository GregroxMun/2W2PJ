			description = Dord is a large asteroid, the largest known body to orbit closer to Pyri than Armstrong. Its orbit can bring it remarkably close to Armstrong, making it an interesting observing target for amateurs on the twilight rim. It has several notable albedo features on its surface, hopefully belying an interesting history- it's quite possible that Dord is one of the more accessible protoplanetary bodies.\nDord's name comes from some of the earliest observational records known of the asteroid- Ramblefraz Kerman, its likely discoverer, initially believed that it was two objects, which he nicknamed "big D" and "little d" until he realized that it was very hard to tell them apart. The name comes from a caption on one of his sketches: "D or d?" \n-Luna, Wolf-Rayet, and Levana
