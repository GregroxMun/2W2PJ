		DesmetSrfLanded = This place has a certain majesty, in its bizzare angles and slopes.

		BuzzSrfLanded = Remarkably, the surface gravity here is appreciable! You expected to have to shuffle around carefully to keep from flying off into Armstrong orbit, but the gravity is high enough to comfortably walk around! What is going on here??
		BuzzSrfLandedCement = There is a strange hum running through your feet. Surely Buzz isn't actually buzzing, right?
		BuzzSrfLandedSignal = You feel anxious, standing here amongst these walls and flats. There's something you can't quite explain, something permeating the space itself. Something is in trouble. You, uh, probably had better get back to your ship...
		
		DesmetSrfLandedEquator = You feel completely and totally weightless here. Desmet seems to be letting go of you quite easily.

	{
		BuzzSrfLandedRubble = The surface is composed of an iron-nickel-rock amalgamation that closely resembles some meteorites.
		BuzzSrfLandedCement = The surface is composed of an almost monolithic, solid material resembling nothing so much as concrete. By breaking off a chunk with considerable effort, you can see it is composed of an aggregate of smaller pebble-sized pieces mixed into a uniform, slightly porous rocky material. Isotopic ratios resemble those found in Armstrong's crust.
		BuzzSrfLandedSmoothCraters = The surface is composed of large chunks of loose rubble and dust with a composition resembling hardcore construction waste more than anything natural.
		BuzzSrfLandedNMountain = The surface is composed of an iron-nickel-rock amalgamation that closely resembles some meteorites.
		BuzzSrfLandedSMountain = The surface is composed of an iron-nickel-rock amalgamation that closely resembles some meteorites.
		BuzzSrfLandedSignal = Despite the texture and general appearance of the surface here closely resembling concrete, the material is so hard that it does not allow you to scrape, cut, break, chisel, or otherwise harvest a piece of it. You settle for a small pebble that clearly did not originate from this structure.
		BuzzSrfLandedRubbleCraters = The surface is composed of an iron-nickel-rock amalgamation that closely resembles some meteorites.
		
		DesmetSrfLanded = Desmet is composed of rubble made of a dense rocky iron aggregate packed together with a fine dusty regolith.
		DesmetSrfLandedBasin = The sample is composed of volatile ices, mainly water ice and carbon dioxide, with traces of oxygen, nitrogen, methane, and ammonia.
		DesmetSrfLandedEquator = Desmet's surface is really well put together here, and devoid of any dust or rubble. It's made of a dense rocky aggregate.

		DesmetSrfLandedBasin = It is VERY cold here. Ingress Basin gets no heating from any star.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		BuzzInSpace = When exposed to the hard vacuum, the goo begins to swell, and the fluids at the surface of the goo seem to be boiling. The goo is developing a hardened skin to cope, but after a a few mintues of exposure, the goo seems to be entering a dormant state as a result of a lack of oxygen to breathe.
		BuzzSrfLanded = The goo seems to be vibrating loudly enough to produce a low, audible tone. Fascinating! You observe it as long as you can, before it dies a typical hypobaric death--after about twice as long as usual.

		BuzzSrfLanded = There is a faint repeating vibration pattern registering throughout the surface. There's a chance it could be noise from various whirring systems on the spacecraft, but nothing on the craft ought to be whirring this much.

		Buzz = The instrument is reading a gravioli count which is over one hundred times too high according to established physics. You're not sure what this thing is, but it's not an asteroid, that's for sure.
		BuzzSrfLandedCement = The instrument is reading a gravioli count which is over one hundred times too high according to established physics. You're not sure what this thing is, but it's not an asteroid, that's for sure. The gravitational field seems to be reduced in intensity with almost exactly the inverse square of the distance to the geometric center of Buzz, implying a massively concentrated core.
		BuzzSrfLandedSignal = The instrument is reading small amounts of *positive* graviolis, voiding the warranty of your negative gravioli detector.
		
		Desmet = Gravioli counts indicate that Desmet has a fairly uniform composition, with a somewhat consistent surface gravity across its surface, implying it is not differentiated. \n\nYes, that's what it says. Ignore the actual readouts, because the Kerbal Space Program's part designers built a gravioli detector that pretends the object has point gravity, and we all know point gravity isn't real. The scientists resting against the fourth wall of the mission control center have confirmed that the actual gravioli readings say what we said they said.
