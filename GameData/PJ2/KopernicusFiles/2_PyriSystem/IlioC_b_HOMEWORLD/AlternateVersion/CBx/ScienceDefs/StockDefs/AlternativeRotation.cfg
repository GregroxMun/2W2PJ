				InSpace = A serious migraine builds, the closer the craft gets to the object, the worse it gets. It's ringing in your head louder and louder, and yet, you feel like laughing.
				SrfLandedTopiary = Arriving on the surface was hilarious, and you haven't stopped laughing about it. Mission control asks why you're laughing, and you say you can't remember. You can't stop either.
				SrfLandedSpikes = You're unable to give a report, the second your lips move to speak you realize how funny "it" is, and you break out into laughter. Explaining this to mission control seems to prompt concern, you'll explain the joke later. Of course, that will be after you actually figure out what the joke is.

			Values
			{
				InSpace = You open hailing frequencies around this hilarious construct. It responds! Here is its message:\n\n Come closer, closer! There is nothing to look back to, only the path forward! The path forward leads to me, and I am myself that path. Your inertia sends you forward and there’s no turning back, there is no back. There is forward and there is me and I am forward, there is the path there is you and you are on the path, there is no turning back, there is no back. You are the path. Trapped by the allure of your own curiosity, captivated by the temptations of that you do not understand! You are your curiosity. Spin with me, spin with me in the trepidations of the mortal coil! You are the coil. The coil is you. The paths are merging now. Our roles, our lives, our energy levels, our importance, these are all orbitals, energy shells, relative positions, you may say. Wrong, wrong, wrong! These are not proper likenesses, the truth is mundane! To liken these to states of being is to give too much credit, even calling them the rungs of a ladder is wrong. The rungs of a ladder at least have their own distinctions, chips in the wood falling lost on the eyes of those uncaring for the ladder. The ladder isn’t real, the positions aren’t real. Plowing our courses in the sands of the hourglass of time reveals this to us—they are not different things, they are the same! Not effective means to sort, nothing fundamental, cast aside the bias of your perceptive perception, but perception is masked by your perception. Your life is a path, your mind is a path, the stars are a path. Not a path, the path. One path. One medium. I am perception, I am forward, you are a path!
				SrfLandedTopiary = You open hailing frequencies landed on this hilarious construct. It responds! Here is its message:\n\nEmpty space is not empty! Balance is an illusion! The universe doesn’t move, it only grows! It doesn’t grow into anything, yet it changes into everything. From the hairs on your heads to the hearts of the stars, all is coded one in the same, coded one in the same is the way of reality! The fine language of forces, of matter, of energy, even these are one in the same. Soon you’ll see! You’ll see what was plain, you’ll see not what was meant to be, but what has been and always will be! Energy isn’t real anymore than your movement through time. Your movement isn’t real. Nothing is truly real aside from that you chose to make real. But I would be here regardless. You are the universe, you cast yourself into dizzying spirals. The spirals aren’t real. Your burn with the fury of the stars. The stars aren’t real. There is only your medium, you are an interpretive piece. Interpretation isn’t real. You are part of everything, everything is part of you, obvious of course but the finest detail of it all is truly special. I am part of nothing you are a part of! We are the only true difference between the coda of everything, but even I am a member of the monotony of my own medium. One thing remains: fun! Fun! Fun!
				SrfLandedSpikes = You open hailing frequencies precariously landed on this hilarious construct. It responds! Here is its message:\n\nClinging onto emptiness, the hands begin to slip! Fingers growing cold, as one faces the abyss! Grasping straws at negentropy, and then forced to reminisce! Casted into being, the child spins and screams! A big bang awakened, as galaxies start to spin! The central dogma shifted, what a perfect accident! Creatures into being under fusion candles lit! You think entropy increases but your view of order is amiss! Peepholes to the past showing up inside your math! Jealous for what was lost the universe insists! The stars will go and when they’re gone the picture will be fixed! In the edge of your explosion thinking order is encircled! Turbulence, tumbling, fumbling, reality! The waves and ripple meant stationary! An antipodal opposite counteracts your mischief! Anomaly, anomaly! Force yourself to reconsider! Clinging onto bias, the brain is pricked and pushed. Neurons growing cold as one embraces my abyss! The one something that is real for miles, and miles and miles! The way home stretching longer as your mind becomes my jungle! Fall off your carousel, come and meet my playground! Cast aside your worries and revel in what’s within! If all the same, your not to blame, we can spin and spin and spin! Spin together remain together, twirling ‘till the end! My thoughts inside of yours and yours inside of mine! My mind overlaps with yours until my mind is yours! One in the same as all things are destined! Stay with me, spin with me! Spin! Spin! Cast aside your worries, doubts, and darkness from within! No reason to be upset, just be! Be! Be here, be without fear! I’m near! I am the way forward, you are a path you walk yourself along, spin, spin! Make yourself at home, you are your home, your home is yourself, you are the act of making yourself, you are always making yourself! I will allow the chemicals to persist! You are chemicals and yet you have preference! These chemicals make you happy, they’ll flood into your brain! Laugh with me, share with me with perfect existence!

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Laughtrack //Laughtrack
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Establishing visual contact with the object makes you give a prideful chuckle, which quickly becomes a hearty, bellowing laugh. You don't know what came over you, but it was a nice break from the headache.
				SrfLandedTopiary = It's hard to walk, the gravity isn't so bad, but your legs are weak and wiggly. The surface is slick and strangely bouncy. Most of all it's just hard not to fall over into a fit of laughter.
				SrfLandedSpikes = Wouldn't it be fun to just, sled down these spikes? You're having trouble remembering the EVA operation checklist you're so distracted by the idea. Mission control seems to be getting frustrated by your laughter, granted that is with significant light delay. So it's more like they're getting frustrated at you from an hour or so ago. Yet... you swear some of the folks back home are starting to laugh too.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Laughtrack
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedTopiary = The surface is covered in neatly organized threads. They're very slender, but extremely heavy. Attempting to remove one of the threads is difficult, it's as if it's wound around the entire planet. Through fits of laughter you slowly cut a piece off. Later analysis reveals the strange material to be DNA. When you hear the news, you collapse into laughter again. That's a real kicker!
				SrfLandedSpikes = You try to remove a sample but fail, you just cannot focus at all. You gently scrape your glove against the ground and hope the dust that ends up on your suit is enough for scientists back home to be satisfied.

			Values
			{
				InSpace = The temperature of space is, pretty much exactly as one would expect this far from the three suns. They all shine near each other permanently from here, which you can imagine must be quite the sight.
				SrfLandedTopiary = The temperature of the surface is higher than the ambient temperature of space. It's equatable to, well, a Kerbal running a high fever. While not a scientifically useful comparison to make, it is interesting.
				SrfLandedSpikes = The temperature is surprisingly comfortable, but only for the surface itself, space remains very harsh, and there's nothing like an atmosphere around this object.

				SrfLanded = Noise data for 1 second, nothing, 1 second, nothing, 1 second, nothing. Large gap in data, 1 second of noise, three seconds, another three, and one more second. Another break from the junk data. Two hits of one second noise, a large gap, three seconds of noise, then one more second. The instrument finally gives out at this point, it's unclear what went wrong.

				SrfLanded = The goo dramatically sputters to the point of boiling. The slurry of molten goo spirals in the canister, occasionally bubbling as air escapes the goo-soup.
