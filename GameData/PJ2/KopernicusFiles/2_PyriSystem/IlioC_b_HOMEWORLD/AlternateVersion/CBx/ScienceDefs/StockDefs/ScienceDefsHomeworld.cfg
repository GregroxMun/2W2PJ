Fed through the universal translator algorithims:\n\n "I waited, my molten heart was aching, basking in the heat of a young protostar, and I waited. I was patient, contented, I knew if I stood here long enough, kept myself in steady pause, gravity would do its work, there would be a chance. The system collapsed. Slowly, I watched the birth of these worlds we now stand centered between, I watched the birth and rise and decline and denaturing of impact families. I watched as my three chances slowly spiraled into being. The first and third were much too small, but the centerworld, the centerworld was large, I could feel it. I prayed it somehow won out, that the gamble payed off. But I didn’t need to. Soon enough you came, you and your interstellar cousins and neighbors, together, to settle the centerworld. Now you’re here, with me, and you’re as beautiful as I could’ve ever imaged...\nI have children, of a sort. I cannot see as far as they’ve wandered. They’re alright wherever they now lay, but I would quite like to know… where they’ve chosen to plant themselves."

				SrfLanded = And it is a song, a mere whisper, a dirge, a cry for help. It is exhorting the void to listen, demanding a response. That is life as a whole: the voice calling "I was here, dammit, listen!" Antichthon is the answer: I know you are here. I see you. You will be remembered. The processes that formed those spiral paths- they are the universe speaking. You can trace those spirals ever-downward, on scales from the planetary to the molecular. The fractal is all-encompassing. You believe, don't you? Let's go there and find out. Together, we will be remembered.
