			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = Temperature is as predicted so far. Nice and cool.
				FlyingLow = The temperature begins increasing above what was expected. Hopefully it'll stop going up soon.
				SrfLanded = Its way hotter here than anticipated. Definitely too hot for anyone to live here. Something on the planet seems to be generating additional heat.
				SrfSplashed = The water temperature is near boiling! Its like the planet wants to cook your craft for dinner.
