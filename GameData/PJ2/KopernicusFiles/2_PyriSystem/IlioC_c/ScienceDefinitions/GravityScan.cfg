			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You're happy to report that the surface gravity here is not trying to crush you into a pancake!
				InSpaceHigh = Combining gravioli counts and the spacecraft's trajectory, we are able to finally get a good reading on Haut-Oklo's density. And hoo-boy, it's much denser than expected for a planet of its size.
				InSpaceLow = Haut-Oklo seems to be largely made up of a dense iron core with a relatively small, dense mantle, with voids and hollows in its crust.
