			name = HautOklo
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You look down at Haut-Oklo's seas and thick atmosphere. Surely this place has to be more habitable than Armstrong, right? Fascinatingly, Haut-Oklo's far-side doesn't seem to be noticably different to its near-side. Could there be something keeping the entire planet warm?
				InSpaceLow = The geiger counter mission control made you bring clicks a few more times then usual. Surely its nothing to worry about.
				FlyingHigh = The atmosphere here is already thicker than on Armstrong, and you're not even close to the surface!
				FlyingLow = The geiger counter is really making some noise now. Maybe you shouldn't get closer to the surface.
				SrfLanded = Mission control tells you the radiation is "within acceptable parameters". You're about to suggest returning to orbit early, when a series of rumbles from deep below shake your craft.
				SrfSplashed = You hold on tight as your craft sways significantly in the ocean currents.
