			name = HautOklo
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = After marveling at Haut-Oklo's beauty for a bit more, you turn around to look where you came from. Armstrong is still clearly visible in the distance.
				InSpaceLow = You finally get a closer look at the surface. Its mostly plain rock, with the occasional mountain range. Yes, definitely a lot of free real estate!
				FlyingHigh = Just because you're used to going outside in Armstrong's thin atmosphere, doesn't make you qualified to be leaving the craft here, while traveling as fast as you are. You should get back inside now!
				SrfLanded = A thin yet of steam suddenly errupts out of a crack in the ground next to you, narrowly missing you! The geiger counter crackles as the steam and dust disperse around you. You begin to realize you might've over-hyped this planet a bit.
				SrfSplashed = The liquid feels oddly thicc as you swim through it. Mission controls assures you that there is water mixed in there, but advises you not to drink any. Not like you'd survive swallowing it. Your spacesuit's cooling system is working overdrive trying to compensate for the high temperature of the liquid.
