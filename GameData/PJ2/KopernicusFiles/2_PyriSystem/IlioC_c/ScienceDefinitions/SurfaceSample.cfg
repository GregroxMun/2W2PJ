			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Your suit's geiger counter clicks profusely as you pick up a sample. Your suit has a lead lining, right? The sample appears to be rich in highly radioactive isotopes of Uranium. You decided to bring a small metal box you found in your capsule to contain the rock samples, rather than the usual sample containers. Better be safe then sorry.
				SrfSplashed = You begin to be filled with dread as you fill a lead-lined sample container with this water. The Geiger counter only gets LOUDER as you submerge it. This is a mild salty brine, except that the brine is... uranium saltwater.
