		Body
		{
			name = HautOklo
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = So far it looks like a fairly regular atmosphere made up mostly of COâ‚‚.
				FlyingLow = Significant amounts of both Xenon and Krypton are detected here, with the analysis indicating the presence of exotic and unstable isotopes of both elements.
				SrfLanded = Radiation begins to interfer with some of the instrument, although its impossible to tell if its because of the radioactive isotopes in the air.
				SrfSplashed = Something is preventing the device from operating correctly. Is it the radiation again? No, nope, its just water seeping in.
