			description = Ljós is a curious little moon. It behaves as though it is held in orbit by the massive Máni nearby, and yet it in actuality orbits Bifröst, merely never straying from its large neighbor - the first discovered "quasi-subsatellite". At such proximity to such a massive planet, however, the high eccentricity orbit this forces Ljós into causes it to be wracked by tidal forces extreme enough to heat it to a glow - though scientists wonder how it could survive that with such a small size.\n\n<color=#2f8b1b> - WarriorSabe</color>
