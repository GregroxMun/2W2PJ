				InSpaceHigh = The luminous globe of lava below the craft looks thoroughly unpleasant to land on. Even the solid parts seem ready to melt at any moment.
				InSpaceHigh = You wonder how the nearby moon could have even come to exist. Perhaps a closer investigation is warranted.
				//InSpaceHigh = The warmth you feel radiating through the window even from space can't possibly be a good sign.
				InSpaceLow = The warmth you feel radiating through the window even from space can't possibly be a good sign.
				//InSpaceLow = For such a small moon, the orbital velocity is surprisingly high. Hopefully that doesn't bode too poorly for a landing.
				InSpaceLow = The small landmasses below are incredibly jagged and glow from their heat in places, but seem to have a few safe areas to touch down.
				
				SrfSplashed = As the ship begins to melt around you, you wonder how you got into this mess.
				SrfSplashed = This is most definitely lava, and we should most definitely get out of it immediately.
				
				SrfLandedCoasts = The red glow of the ground around you and rising cabin temperatures give the impression that this is not somewhere to stay long.
				SrfLandedCoasts = Leaving the safety of the vehicle here is likely a bad idea. But what is science if not dangerous?
				
				SrfLandedCliffs = This can't possibly be a stable landing site.
				SrfLandedCliffs = Better keep the engines on standby so the ship doesn't fall to its doom.
				
				SrfLandedSlopes = The heat is surprisingly bearable at these altitudes. The ground seems to threaten to dump you somewhere a bit hotter, however.
				SrfLandedSlopes = You try to admire the view, but the settling of the ship reminds you of the danger lurking below.
				
				SrfLandedFlats = For a molten moon that seems to defy belief, it's surprisingly peaceful here. This perch has quite the view...
				SrfLandedFlats = Part of Ljós that's not actively trying to destroy everything that lands there? Incredible!

				SrfLanded = The ground seems to be solid iron alloy, and excising a piece of it proves to be quite difficult.
				SrfLanded = The difficulty of collecting a sample of the metallic surface puts to rest your burning questions of how this moon is still intact.
				
				SrfSplashed = All silicate matter on this moon seems to have melted into these oceans, much as any astronaut foolish enough to swim in it will. Wait...
				SrfSplashed = As you wonder how you are still alive, you collect a sample of the seas you swim in. Yep, that's lava alright.
				
				SrfLandedCoasts = You find that the solid metal you're standing on is much less solid than you would like as you collect a piece of it.
				SrfLandedCoasts = The extreme heat has softened the iron alloy in your hands, and threatens to destroy anything you might find to store it in.

				InSpaceHigh = What a tiny little moon! You could probably land on it with just your EVA pack. Whether that's a good idea, however, is another story.
				InSpaceHigh = EVA never ceases to provide breathtaking views, and that's especially true here.
				InSpaceLow = This place sure is... warm. Maybe a spacewalk wasn't the best idea after all.
				InSpaceLow = If only you had a signalscope here...
				
				InSpaceLowSeas = The light of the world below reminds you of a lantern.
				InSpaceLowSeas = This place sure is... warm. Maybe a spacewalk wasn't the best idea after all.
				
				SrfSplashed = Having succeeded in landing on Ljós, you prepare for your victory candescence.
				SrfSplashed = Swimming in lava, it turns out, is extremely unpleasant. Getting out of the lava immediately would be a good idea.
				
				SrfLandedCoasts = The suit's climate control is working overtime here, and will likely fail soon. Moving to a higher elevation would likely be wise.
				SrfLandedCoasts = Even remaining out of the lava you can feel the blistering heat through your suit. These coasts don't seem much better than the seas themselves.
				
				SrfLandedSlopes = This feels like it would be a fun place to go sledding, if there was more gravity and less lava.
				SrfLandedSlopes = After briefly loosing your footing while looking up at the alien sky, you decide it's a good idea to not risk sliding somewhere unpleasant.
				
				SrfLandedFlats = As you begin to think perhaps this moon isn't so bad after all, a sudden shift of the ground reminds you that this moon is, in fact, highly dangerous.
				SrfLandedFlats = From the safety of your landing site, you take in the views. The red glow looks like fog from above, and for a second you forget there's no atmosphere here.
				
				SrfLandedCliffs = Falling down this cliff would likely go very poorly, even with the low gravity here.
				SrfLandedCliffs = After briefly loosing your footing while looking up at the alien sky, you decide it's a good idea to not risk sliding somewhere unpleasant.

				SrfLanded = The thermometer shows what a look at the surroundings can already tell you: this place is hot.
				
				SrfLandedCoasts = Temperatures here are on the order of a thousand degrees. It's no wonder this moon's surface is mostly lava.

				SrfLanded = The goo contracts into a dark, hollow sphere. Perhaps a defensive reaction?
				SrfLanded = The goo would rather be on Máni right now.

				InSpaceLow = This moon is really dense, and has much more gravity than you might expect for its size.
				InSpaceLow = Did the detector just pick up another object?
				
				InSpaceHighSeas = The gravity over these seas seems to be the weakest, they must be significantly less dense than the rest of the moon.
				InSpaceLowSeas = Gravity variations seem to suggest a submarine topography dominated by sharp ridges and valleys. Too bad its exploration would be nigh-impossible.
				
				SrfLanded = The large mountains distort your readings, and the gravity of Bifröst can easily be picked up on. Some more careful analysis shows the gravity of Máni as well.

				SrfLanded = All the rumbling picked up gives the impression that this is not a good place to be. Some quakes seem like they should be strong enough to hurl lava straight into space!
				
				SrfLandedSlopes = You can't tell if the constant vibrations come from the moon or the craft slipping down the slope. It's probably both, and neither seem like a good sign.
				
				SrflandedCoasts = The softened terrain here seems to dampen the sensor's readings. The stronger quakes definitely show up, however.
