				InSpaceHigh = Looking out the window, you are treated to the stunning yet unnerving sight of the multicolored disk of light surrounding the massive planet. As you watch, you can see it slowly shifting.
				InSpaceHigh = Somehow, the safety of the capsule seems particularly welcome here despite, or perhaps because of, the spectacular views.
				InSpaceLow = Only from up close can the true scale of this planet be fully appreciated. It is awe inspiring and terrifying.
				InSpaceLow = This is a place unlike any other, containing a power unmatched by most. You can feel it in your bones.

			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = As the rainbow band shimmers ahead of you and a massive planet churns far below, there is a strange peace, like the calm before a storm.
				InSpaceHigh = The sights are unmatched, but something about this place makes you feel particularly exposed floating outside.
				InSpaceLow = Massive storms churn in the atmosphere of Bifröst, seemingly unending. A quiet show of the planet's power.
				InSpaceLow = Taking your eyes away from the obvious sights of the planet, you find yourself disoriented by how far the stars have moved.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = Bifröst
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Unexpectedly, the thermometer begins to pick up on external heat, even when shaded from all stars. The accumulated damage to the instrument doesn't seem to account for the discrepancy. This calls for further investigation.
				InSpaceHigh = Temperatures here are noticeably higher than they should be when starlight and planetshine are accounted for. The instrument seems to be showing signs of damage, but it's working well enough to suggest these readings are real.
				InSpaceLow = From up close to the planet, the anomalous behavior has mostly stopped. Some radiant heat from the moons exists, but it's insignificant at such a distance.
				InSpaceLow = The extra heat seems to be gone now - it must not have originated from the planet's surface.

		{

			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The goo gains an iridescent sheen. It then catches fire, before shattering. Eventually it returns to normal, and the process repeats.
				InSpaceLow = The container doors refuse to open at first. They seemed to have suffered damage of some sort as a result of the goo's actions - but it is simply sitting there, unmoving.

		{

			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The instrument reads zer- wait that can't be right. How is there air pressure here? It's not much but it is most definitely there.
				InSpaceHigh = The barometer appears to be malfunctioning. A diagnostic shows that it is, but the data is correct: there are millipascal-level ambient pressures here. How could that be?
				InSpaceLow = While it remains damaged, readings have returned to the expected values of zero now. Curious.
				InSpaceLow = Readings back to vacuum. It's as if the anomalous pressure never existed.

	{
		Body
		{
			name = Bifröst
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = While the expensive and delicate equipment is degrading at an alarming rate, it remains capable of logging the complex interactions of the system.
				InSpaceHigh = The complex gravitational interactions between the enormous spinning mass below, the enormous burning mass in the distance, and all these moons make some very fun squiggles on the readouts.
				InSpaceLow = High-resolution gravitational data seems to suggest that Bifröst has a very small core, at least considering its enormous mass. It's almost entirely metallic hydrogen, all spinning at terrifying speeds.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = Bifröst
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = After failing to respond a few times, the doors finally open. Samples immediately start brightly glowing, and some react as though they've had a large electric current passed through them. Surely that's not a good sign.
				InSpaceHigh = The high radiation environment caused a few of the samples to glow. A lot. A really quite alarming amount, really. Perhaps it is best not to think about this too much.
				InSpaceLow = The environment near the planet doesn't seem to cause as extreme of a reaction in the materials bay as that further out.
				InSpaceLow = Some samples float out of the bay, as you realize you subconciously left the vehicle spinning to track the planet below. Oops.

	{
		Body
		{
			name = Bifröst
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Magnetic field readings are off the charts! The field lines appear confined into a flat disk, as though by a sheet of highly energized plasma. Befuddled, the scientist on duty takes a break from the data to take in the sight of the colorful plane of light that surrounds this planet, wondering what could cause those readings.
				InSpaceLow = Close to the planet, there is no trace of the magnetodisk structure visible in the data before. Magnetic fields seem to behave fairly typically, if at an extreme intensity that threatens to wipe your cmoputers.
