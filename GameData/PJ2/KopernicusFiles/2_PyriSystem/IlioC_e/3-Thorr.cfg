			description = The smallest moon of Bifröst can be found embedded within its most distinctive feature. Very little is known about this world, as it is too small to resolve from Armstrong, but it does appear to emit some amount of light on its own, and has an irregular and erratic-seeming lightcurve. Þórr's mysteries make for an enticing target, though many hypotheses for the nature of it and its surroundings make it out to be a dangerous place.\n\n<color=#2f8b1b> - WarriorSabe</color>
