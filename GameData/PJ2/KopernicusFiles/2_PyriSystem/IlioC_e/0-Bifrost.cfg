			description = The largest and most massive planet of Pyri, Bifröst is a world of mystery and extremes. Nearly big enough to be a binary companion of its star, it has managed to collect a number of moons, while its gravitational influence is felt far and wide.\n\nWhen viewed through a telescope, or just a keen eye alone from a dark enough site, its most striking and distinctive feature becomes visible: the so-called chromatic disk. Just what it is remains a mystery, but to many it feels distinctly unnatural (though scientists claim otherwise), and it is important to most mythologies. It is believed by many that the legendary Kraken resides somewhere around here.\n\n<color=#2f8b1b> - WarriorSabe</color>
