	@RESULTS
	{
		MillieInSpaceHigh = It looks really familiar to an object from Human Space Program. Not sure which one though.
		MillieInSpaceHigh = From a distance Millie's Dragon kind of looks like a loading symbol.
		MillieInSpaceLow = The rings look really pretty! It's best to admire them from a distance. 
		MillieSrfLanded = There's so many craters! What did poor Millie do?
		MillieSrfLandedMoxxieBasin = What type of name is Moxxie? Did someone really throw this massive impact basin's name away to a reference?
		MillieSrfLandedBluelands = The surface looks so... surreal? It's like a sea of stars...

		CasyInSpace = I can almost see it being torn apart from here! How long does this moon have?
		CasyInSpace = So this object is responsible for Millie's Dragon, and all of the IR radiation we picked up. 
		CasySrfLanded = Well, we got here. While we still could, anyway.
		CasySrfLandedExposedIce = It's quite a nice scientific opportunity, that Casy is being destroyed. We wouldn't be able to take such a deep look inside otherwise.
		CasySrfLandedThawingDust = It's interesting to see how the surface and underground mix here.
		CasySrfLandedSurfaceIce = Here the surface is relatively intact. How long it will stay like that is a good question.

		EronInSpace = Pardon me, but WHAT is THAT?
		EronSrfLanded = I'm going to honest, I really don't like it here. Something about it is just really off.
		EronSrfLandedUnderside = Is there even an underside to this thing? Does it depend on perspective?
		EronSrfLandedEOTW = That's a really dramatic name for a biome. It's just a rock in space.
		EronSrfLandedInnerBowl = Can we please not go any further north?
		EronSrfLandedPolarBowl = I have a feeling this specific place used to be a lot worse, but I can't really put my finger on why or how.
