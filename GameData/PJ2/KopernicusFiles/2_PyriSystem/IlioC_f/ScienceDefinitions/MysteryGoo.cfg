		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Sinacin
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The goo survives for a few minutes with anaerobic respiration, but the cytoplasm gets sucked out of all the cells gradually as the goo succumbs to the vacuum of space. 
				InSpaceLow = The goo only survives a few seconds as the extreme ionizing radiation from Sinacin's lower radiaton belt rips apart the goo's cells.
				FlyingHigh = The goo gets cooked alive by the plasma.
				FlyingLow = The goo begins anaerobic respiration, and is unaffected by the Carbon Monoxide and Ozone. It is able to survive up here, but as it descends, the concentration of Osmium Tetroxide builds up and kills the goo.
				SrfLandedIrridiated_Flats = The goo quickly gets used to the crushing gravity, and becomes more vicsous to compensate; however, the coping is short lived as the Osmium Tetroxide eats away at the cells, allowing Ozone to enter and kill the cells. The goo dies in a few minutes.
				SrfSplashed = The goo is able to avoid the corrosive Osmium Tetroxide gas by being underneath this 'liquid', and survives through anaerobic respiration.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Rangon
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The goo only survives a few seconds as the extreme ionizing radiation from Sinacin's lower radiaton belt rips apart the goo's cells.
				InSpaceLow = The goo only survives a few seconds as the extreme ionizing radiation from Sinacin's lower radiaton belt rips apart the goo's cells.
				SrfLandedDusty_Highlands = The goo only survives a few seconds as the extreme ionizing radiation from Sinacin's lower radiaton belt rips apart the goo's cells.
				SrfLandedDusty_Lowlands = The goo survives for slightly longer as some of the radiation is reflected by the mountains above, but its fate is only slightly delayed.

		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Glice
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The goo tries its aerobic respiration, but its cells are slowly ripped apart by the upper radiation belt of Glice and Sinacin, and along with the hard vacuum, the goo makes it all but a few minutes.
				InSpaceLow = The goo only survives a few seconds as the extreme ionizing radiation from Glice's lower radiaton belt rips apart the goo's cells.
				FlyingHigh = The goo gets cooked alive by the plasma.
				FlyingLow = The goo is able to survive via anaerobic respiration. As the pressure continues to rise, it forms a protein exoskeleton to resist.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Caua
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The goo survives for a few minutes with anaerobic respiration, but the cytoplasm gets sucked out of all the cells gradually as the goo succumbs to the vacuum of space.
				InSpaceLow = Although there is a higher than normal radiation level here in the lower Caua belt, the goo has enough time to start building a protein exoskeleton to protect from the radiation; however, this is futile as the vacuum of space kills the goo before it finishes making its shell.
				FlyingHigh = The goo gets cooked alive by the plasma.
				FLyingLow = The goo is able to breathe the Oxygen in the atmosphere, but begins to shake and shiver to warm itself up. The air is extremely cold, and the goo has a difficult time coping with the tempurature.
				SrfLanded = The goo loves the highly Oxygenated environment, though it is very cold. The goo compensates by increasing its activity through shaking and shivering. The radiation levels are also quite low, as Caua's atmosphere, along with the magnetic fields of Sinacin, Glice, and Caua, are able to shield the surface. The goo is easily capable of surviving here.

				InSpaceHigh = The goo survives for a few minutes with anaerobic respiration, but the cytoplasm gets sucked out of all the cells gradually as the goo succumbs to the vacuum of space.
				InSpaceLow = Although there is a slightly higher than normal radiation level here in the lower Alia belt, the goo has enough time to start building a protein exoskeleton to protect from the radiation; however, this is futile as the vacuum of space kills the goo before it finishes making its shell.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Jones
			Values
			{
			InSpaceHigh = Although there is a slightly higher than normal radiation level here in the lower Alia belt, the goo has enough time to start building a protein exoskeleton to protect from the radiation; however, this is futile as the vacuum of space kills the goo before it finishes making its shell.
			InSpaceLow = Although there is a slightly higher than normal radiation level here in the lower Alia belt, the goo has enough time to start building a protein exoskeleton to protect from the radiation; however, this is futile as the vacuum of space kills the goo before it finishes making its shell.
			FlyingHigh = The goo survives slightly longer than it would in a vacuum, as the slight atmospheric pressure lets it live a bit longer.
			FlyingLow = The atmospheric pressure is extremely low, but survivable for the goo. It is also extremely cold, and the goo does its tried and true shaking and shivering to stay warm; though, having to use anaerobic respiration makes this more energy consuming than it normally would.
			SrfLanded = The atmospheric pressure is extremely low, but survivable for the goo. It is also extremely cold, and the goo does its tried and true shaking and shivering to stay warm; though, having to use anaerobic respiration makes this more energy consuming than it normally would.
