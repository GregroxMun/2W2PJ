		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Sinacin
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = You look at the clouds whizzing below your feet. You then look up and see Caua and Alia just floating there. They are massive worlds just hovering there, dwarfed by the titan that is Sinacin. You begin to get scared, and want to go back inside the safety of your craft.
				InSpaceHigh = It is so surreal seeing Sinacin this close up. It has always been here, staring at Armstrong, waiting patiently for visitors. Here you are now, will you get closer?
				FlyingHigh = WHY AM I NOT IN THE CRAFT, WHY AM I OUT HERE, WHAT SCIENCE COULD POSSIBLY BE GAINED FROM THIS!!!
				FlyingLow = There is no way you survive this, you think to yourself.
				SrfLanded = You struggle to stand. The helmet on your head is so heavy you just want to take it off, but the atmosphere is so toxic you would die with one breath. Even getting this suit on inside the capsule was nearly impossible. It's hard to do the science assigned to you when you can barely breathe.
				SrfSplashed = Being in this liquid-of-sorts give you some relief from the unrelenting gee forces of Sinacin, as the "liquid" is able to support your weight, and your body does not have to do all of the work. Mission control wants you to get a sample of it, but you know it will take everything you have to even screw off the lid of the jar. You beg mission control to just let you leave.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Rangon
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The massive, jagged, mountains are truely a sight to behold.
				InSpaceHigh = It is hard to focus on recording your observations of Rangon when Sinacin's clouds are moving at break-neck speed less than 200 kilometers below you.
				SrfLandedDusty_Highlands = It is the weirdest feeling in the world being repelled by the ground. You use your magnetic boot-straps to stay in place on the surface, since Rangon is made of metal. Being so high up, you get a good view of Rangon's terrain. It is quite perculiar, with the impact craters being so irregular in shape. You yearn to go explore them.
				SrfLandedDusty_Lowlands = It is slightly easier to stay on the ground down here, but the magnetic boots are rated for much higher negative gee forces so you dont have to worry. You look at the terrain around you, and seeing the craters and mountains rise nearly a kilometer above you is quite a humbling sight. You try to take a picture with your cell-phone camera, but realize the photo is quite fuzzy and blurry. Then you remember you are inside of Sinacin's radiation belt and without your suit, you would be exposed to lethal doses of radiation in seconds.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Glice
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Being this close to Glice truely lets you appreciate the beauty of this beast. You try to take a picture with your cell-phone camera for your Kerbo-gram, but realize the photo is quite fuzzy and blurry. Then you remember you are inside of Glices's lower radiation belt and without your suit, you would be exposed to lethal doses of radiation in minutes; though, if you took off your suit right now, there would be more immediate problems to worry about.
				InSpaceHigh = The way the clouds blend and twist around the storms, the way they dance around the frigid blue abyss, the way they delicately form massive structures, how pulchritudinous.
				FlyingHigh = Plasma starts to form around the outside of your helmet, and tempurature alarms on your watch start to go off. It is probably best to get back inside before entry gets worse...
				FlyingLow = It is hard to grab your sample for mission control whenever the wind keeps blowing all of your sample jars away!

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Caua
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The snow below you is so bright, that it is hard to focus on your repair! Then you remember you have a visor.
				InSpaceHigh = The way the clouds blend and twist around the storms, the way they dance around the frigid blue abyss, the way they 				
				FlyingHigh = You wonder why you are outside your craft right now. Are you sure you trust your suit's ability to protect you from entry?
				FlyingLow = Although it is really cold outside, you are tempted to take off your hands and feel the crisp air run through your fingers.
				SrfLandedSnowy_Midlands = As you walk through the snow, you observe how it crunches below your feet. You begin to make very scientific measurments on how the snow moves as you lay down and move your arms and legs.
				SrfLandedAncient_Iodized_Lakebeds = Purple snow! How peculiar, it also seems to be slightly more hard and rough compared to the other snow around Caua. You promptly take samples.
				SrfLandedAncient_Rivers = It is kind of surreal to think about how you are standing where a magnificent river used to flow...and may flow again.
				SrfLandedVolcano_Basin = You are amazed at just how wide this volcano basin is, its erruption would have been a sight to behold!
				SrfLandedVolcano_Rim = Looking to the right, you see a steep slope. Looking to the left, you see a steep slope. Which way is the basin again?
				SrfLandedVolcano_Flank = This volcano is so ridiculously large it is hard to tell you are even on a slope!
				SrfLandedRocky_Mountain-Tops = These are the only mountains on Caua, and there are only a few centimeters of snow. You look out over the terrain, feeling on top of the world! Then look up and see Sinacin and Glice and immediately feel small again. On another note, you are tempted to take off your helmet and get a breath of the fresh air. You know it is Oxygen, but unfortunately it is so cold your face would freeze within minutes.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Alia
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = What a perfectly sized world for exploration, you try to convince mission control to send a new rover here.
				InSpaceHigh = It is crazy to think that a world this small can hold onto a moon of its own!
				SrfLandedMidlands = The rock has a beautiful mix of ice and rust.
				SrfLandedLowlands = The ground is very, red.
				SrfLandedAncient_Lava_Chasm = You begin to get scared for some reason, just the fact that this used to be an ancient lava river is kinda terrifying. Then, you look up and see the massive plateau above you. Now you want to leave.
				SrfLandedSmooth_Plateau = With all the lumpy and ragged terrain scattered around this world, its kinda weird being on such a flat area. It would be really fun to drive here.
				SrfLandedRugged_Midlands = Walking here is like hiking back on Armstrong.
				SrfLandedHighlands = You feel like you are on top of the world. You have the sudden urge to throw a good old-fashion pig skin down the mountain, or take a swing with a driver.
				SrfLandedAncient_Impact_Crater-Cano = You are walking on the ancient impact site of a dwarf planet. It's a very weird feeling knowing if you were here just a few million years ago, this world would be a completely different place.
				SrfLandedAncient_Lava_Flow = The terrain here is slightly smoother than the rest of the planet, sans the plateau. You wonder what may have caused this...

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Jones
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = You just want to cuddle this little dude. You could use your jetpack to land on it right now. You beg mission control to let you do this.
				InSpaceHigh = Goofy ahh snow ball below your feet.
				FlyingHigh = Does this even count as an atmosphereic entry? You are going so slow all you feel is a light breeze.
				FlyingLow = Moving your arms, you notice some air resistance! You wonder if you were to attach wings to your suit arms, you would be able to fly.
				SrfLandedIcy_Midlands = The ground is super slippery, and its fun to slide around in the miniscule gravity.
				SrfLandedIcy_Lowlands = You attempt to do a moon-walk on the ice; however, you slip and fall over, in a very comically slow fashion.
