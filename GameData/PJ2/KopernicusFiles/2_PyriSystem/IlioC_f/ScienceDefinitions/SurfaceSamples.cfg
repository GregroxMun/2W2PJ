				SrfLandedIrridiated_Flats = The samples contain fragments of metal and fine dust. Under a microscope inside the capsule, the fragments of metal have a distinct purple hue and are extremely dense. It is likely that they contain heavy metals such as Bismuth, Iridium, Osmium, Tungsten, Gold, and Platinum; though, to get a true idea of the composition we need a spectrograph. After separating the dust and metal fragments, you put a geiger counter next to each one. It detects higher levels of alpha particles coming out of the metal fragments.
				SrfSplashed = This 'liquid' is more-so a supercritical mixture, which turns to gas under the one-atmosphere of pressure of the capsule. The mixture is likely to contain super-critical Carbon Monoxide, Krypton, Argon, and trace amounts of Xenon. A spectrograph is needed to get the true composition.

			name = PJ2/Rangon
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedDusty_Highlands = Trying to get a sample is nearly impossible, as the the only thing you can get in the container is the dust. Even that is hard since it is magnetically attracted to the surface. After scraping off some dust, you notice that it is extremely shiny below. It is hard and smooth, impossible to get in the container. You deduce that it is metal, and is most likely an Irido-Platinum alloy. After taking measurments of the gravity and the radius of Rangon, your assumption is most likely correct.
				SrfLandedDusty_Lowlands = Trying to get a sample is nearly impossible, as the the only thing you can get in the container is the dust. Even that is hard since it is magnetically attracted to the surface. After scraping off some dust, the dust down here is noticiably thicker than in the mountaintops, you notice that it is extremely shiny below. It is hard and smooth, impossible to get in the container. You deduce that it is metal, and is most likely an Irido-Platinum alloy. After taking measurments of the gravity and the radius of Rangon, your assumption is most likely correct.

				SrfLandedSnowy_Midlands = You get a sample of the snow. Feeling it, it is remarkably similar to the snow back on Armstrong. Despite the deadly cold, you quickly take off your helemt and take a bite of the snow. It also tastes the same as Armstrong snow, but with a hint of salt. You quickly put your helmet back on and notice some ice forming on your nose.
				SrfLandedAncient_Iodized_Lakebeds = When this sample of snow is melted, it leaves behind a purple crystal-like residue. This is very similar to Iodized salt, though it is very rich in Iodone giving it its purple hue.
				SrfLandedAncient_Rivers = You try to scrape some of the sedimentary rock out from below the snow, as this used to be an ancient lake bed. This should be brought back to Armstrong to be analyzed, as it may contain fossils of ancient life.
				SrfLandedVolcano_Basin = You dig through a few centimeters of snow to get to the obsidian below, and collect a sample of it to see exactly what kind of lava it is... wait... why is it melting in the container? Is this just... ice? You quickly take off your helmet to get a drink of it, and yup, its frozen salt water. Before your face freezes off, you put your helmet back on. You now realize uou forgot to spit out the salt water before you put your helmet back on. Nasty.
				SrfLandedVolcano_Rim = The snow up here is very thick, and you can't dig down enough with your gloved hands to reach anything solid, so you just settle with a sample of the snow. Hopefully it is somewhat different than the rest of Caua's snow.
				SrfLandedVolcano_Flank = The snow here isn't as thick as it is on the rim, but it is still decently thick. You are finally able to fish out a tiny rock in the snow after 15 minutes, and it melts in the container. You radio mission control and tell them to invest in sample containers that don't conduct the heat from your glove.
				SrfLandedRocky_Mountain-Tops = You dig through the snow to get a sample, and there are only a few centimeters of snow! You grab a rock from below the snow, which is interesting because there aren't rocks anywhere else on this planet in any appreciable amounts. These rocks you are finding will be great for the scientists back home to analyze.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Alia
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedMidlands = You grab a rock off of the ground. This is an interesting rock. Actually, you know what, it isn't that interesting of a rock. But with the insane amount of rocks on this world, it is interesting that the universe's cards played out in just the right way for this specific rock to have the next chapter in its journey, be in the palm of your hand.
				SrfLandedLowlands = The rocks here are a lot more red, owing to the fact they aren't covered with as much ice. These rocks are also less slippery than the ones on higher altitudes, for the same reason. The rocks crumble in your hand a bit, and are pretty brittle.
				SrfLandedAncient_Lava_Chasm = The rock here is dark red, and you have to use a pick to be able to get a sample out of the ground. It looks to be made of obsidian and rock, and the layers inside are beautiful. You put this in the container and hope the scientists back home can get some value out of it.
				SrfLandedSmooth_Plateau = The rocks up here seem to be few and far-between, so you just scoop up some sand that seems to be up here. It is interesting in its own right, seemingly swept by winds that used to be here many years ago.
				SrfLandedRugged_Midlands = The rocks here are more jagged and rough than the rocks elsewhere on Alia, and seem to have an igneous composition.
				SrfLandedHighlands = You get a chunk of ice and put it in the container. The ice is theorized to contain a lot of Hydrocarbons and Carbon Monoxide, as this ice was most likely deposited up here by the impact of the massive outer-Pyri object many millenia ago.
				SrfLandedAncient_Impact_Crater-Cano = These samples are of extremely high scientific value. It is theorized that this crater was created by an outer-Pyri dwarf planet that impacted Alia. The crater was so deep, that it exposed the lower layers of Alia creating a giant volcano-crater hybrid. Not only could these samples hold clues into the composition of the interior of Alia, but also the composition of the ancient dwarf planet.
				SrfLandedAncient_Lava_Flow = The rock here is extremely hard and smooth, like obsidian. You scrape as much of it off of the ground as you can, but you don't get many big pieces.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Jones
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedIcy_Midlands = You use a pick and get some of the ice. It is a very interesting blue color, and the inside of the ice chunk is seemingly the same color as the ice on the peaks of Alia.
				SrfLandedIcy_Lowlands = The ice here is a little smoother than in the midlands, and is thus harder to get a good sample. The ice has an interesting crystalline structure here as well.
