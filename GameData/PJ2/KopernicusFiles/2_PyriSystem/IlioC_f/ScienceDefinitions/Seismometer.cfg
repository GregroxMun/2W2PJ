	{
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Sinacin
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedIrridiated_Flats = The sensor detecs many quakes, each with very high magnitudes. This is a very angry world.
				SrfSplashed = The sensor detects the accelaration of bobbing up and down in the waves.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Rangon
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The sensor detects nothing but the occasional high velocity impact. When something impacts, the waves reflect back and forth at the frequency of a ringing bell.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Glice
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Really bruh
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Caua
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedSnowy_Midlands = The seismometer detects quick, but high amplitude waves a few kilometers below the surface. This is most likely due to the geothermal activity at the bottom of the sub-surface ocean randomly shooting warm water up to the bottom of the ice, causing it melt in that area. Because the ice in that area is now thinner, it is less structurally stable and cracks, possibly causing the readings detected.
				SrfLandedAncient_Iodized_Lakebeds = The seismometer detects quick, but high amplitude waves less than a kilometer below the surface. This is most likely due to the geothermal activity at the bottom of the sub-surface ocean randomly shooting warm water up to the bottom of the ice, causing it melt in that area. Because the ice in that area is now thinner, it is less structurally stable and cracks, possibly causing the readings detected. On top of this, because the ice is naturally thinner here, the readings are amplified.
				SrfLandedAncient_Rivers = The seismometer detects quick, but high amplitude waves less than a kilometer below the surface. This is most likely due to the geothermal activity at the bottom of the sub-surface ocean randomly shooting warm water up to the bottom of the ice, causing it melt in that area. Because the ice in that area is now thinner, it is less structurally stable and cracks, possibly causing the readings detected. On top of this, because the ice is naturally thinner here, the readings are amplified.
				SrfLandedVolcano_Basin = It detects a rumbling deep below...
				SrfLandedVolcano_Rim = It detects a rumbling deep below...
				SrfLandedVolcano_Flank = It detects the occasional rumble from below.
				SrfLandedRocky_Mountain-Tops = Amy sensitive readings are completely overpowered by frequent perturbations from avalanches

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Alia
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = There isn't anything detected other than very rare tiny quakes. Though, it was predicted there wouldn't be quakes at all. The quakes probably originate because of interior of Alia is still warm from the relatively recent mega-impact.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Jones
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The sensor detects a constant, smooth, rattle below the surface, similar to water running through a pipe. This reading is probably from the predicted subsurface ocean.
