		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Sinacin
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Some samples inside glow violently in the extreme radiation environmment of the lower Sinacinal radiation belt, while others are completely destroyed.
				InSpaceHigh = Most of the samples do nothing, while other ones gently glow due to solar and cosmic radiation.
				FlyingHigh = Most samples just fly out of the container, while the remaining ones are cooked by the entry plasma.
				FlyingLow = A lot of the inert samples are crushed to the bottom of the container by the gravity, while nearly all of the biological samples die in the toxic atmosphere.
				SrfLandedIrridiated_Flats = Not only are the samples crushed by the gravity, but the pressure is slowly squishing them. It is hard to get science from them.
				SrfSplashed = The samples are intensly squeezed by the pressure, and supercritical fluid begins to creep inside the materials bay. The samples don't seem to react much with it; however, a sample of Chlorine gas seems to slowly be converting to Phosgene. This is probably due to elemental Chlorine's reaction with Carbon Monoxide.

				InSpaceLow = Some samples inside glow violently in the extreme radiation environmment of the lower Sinacinal radiation belt, while others are completely destroyed.
				InSpaceHigh = Some samples inside glow violently in the extreme radiation environmment of the lower Sinacinal radiation belt, while others are completely destroyed.
				SrfLandedDusty_Highlands = Some samples inside glow violently in the extreme radiation environmment of the lower Sinacinal radiation belt, while others are completely destroyed.
				SrfLandedDusty_Lowlands = The samples glow slightly less, and less samples are destroyed by the radiation. This is probably due to the fact that there is slightly less radiation down here.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Glice
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Some samples inside glow violently in the extreme radiation environmment of the lower Glician radiation belt, while others are completely destroyed.
				InSpaceHigh = Being this high above Glice, the radiation from Glice itself isn't very extreme; however, the upper Glician belt interacts with the upper Sinacinal belt causing magnetic reconnection events. These release lots of ionizing radiation, and cause the samples to either glow brilliantly, or be destroyed completely.
				FlyingHigh = Most samples just fly out of the container, while the remaining ones are cooked by the entry plasma.
				FlyingLow = A sample of Chlorine gas seems to slowly be converting to Phosgene. This is probably due to elemental Chlorine's reaction with the non-trace amounts of Carbon Monoxide in Glice's atmosphere. Other samples don't seem to be reacting with much; though, the biological ones are dying due to the intense pressure.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Caua
			Values
			{
				InSpacelow = The radiation here in the lower Cauian belt, although high, is survivable by the biological samples, for a few hours of course. The inert samples visibly glow.
				InSpaceHigh = Most of the samples do nothing, while other ones gently glow due to solar and cosmic radiation. The upper Cauian belt is too diffuse to have any noticable effect on the samples.
				FlyingHigh = Most samples just fly out of the container, while the remaining ones are cooked by the entry plasma.
				FlyingLow = The biological samples begin to get extremely cold. Some of the more resiliant ones survive, while the more delicate ones die off. The ones that are left flourish in the oxygenated atmosphere, with plenty of snow to staisfy their hydration needs.
				SrfLandedSnowy_Midlands = The inert samples act just like they do back on Armstrong, but with the oxidation taking place a bit faster due to the higher pressure. The biological samples that survive the cold enjoy the high water and Oxygen content.
				SrfLandedAncient_Iodized_Lakebeds = The biological samples tend to spasm a bit as large amounts of Sodium and Potassium Iodide enter diffuse through their cell membranes and cell walls.
				SrflandedAncient_Rivers = The biological samples tend to spasm a bit as large amounts of Sodium and Potassium Iodide diffuse through their cell membranes and cell walls.
				SrfLandedVolcano_Basin = The inert samples act just like they do back on Armstrong, but with the oxidation taking place a bit faster due to the higher pressure. The biological samples that survive the cold enjoy the high water and Oxygen content.
				SrfLandedVolcano_Rim = It is a lethal level of cold up here, even the most resiliant biological samples begin to die. Many of the inert samples stop oxidizing as much as they were, as the extremely low tempuratures lower the chemical activity.
				SrfLandedVolcano_Flank = The inert samples act just like they do back on Armstrong, but with the oxidation taking place a bit faster due to the higher pressure. The biological samples that survive the cold enjoy the high water and Oxygen content.
				SrfLandedRocky_Mountain-Tops = It is a lethal level of cold up here, even the most resiliant biological samples begin to die. Many of the inert samples stop oxidizing as much as they were, as the extremely low tempuratures lower the chemical activity.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Alia
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The samples glow only slightly more than usual, as even though Alia does have a radiation belts, they are pretty weak.
				InSpaceHigh = Most of the samples do nothing, while other ones gently glow due to solar and cosmic radiation. The upper Alian belt is too weak to have any noticable effects on the samples.
				SrfLanded = Most of the samples do nothing, while other ones gently glow due to solar and cosmic radiation. The gravity is weak, and the biological samples have an easy time adjusting.
			}

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Jones
			Alia
			{
				InSpaceLow = The samples glow only slightly more than usual, as Jones is inside of Alia's lower radiation belt.
				InSpaceLow = The samples glow only slightly more than usual, as Jones is inside of Alia's lower radiation belt.
				FlyingHigh = The intert samples begin to grow microscopic layers of ice, most likely depositing from the miniscule amount of water vapor in the upper atmosphere.
				FlyingLow = The samples begin to grow visible levels of water-ice on their surfaces, while some photosynthetic biological samples take in the water and use it for photosynthesis.
				SrfLanded = The samples become coated with ice, and the biological samples begin to freeze from intaking too much water from the atmosphere.
