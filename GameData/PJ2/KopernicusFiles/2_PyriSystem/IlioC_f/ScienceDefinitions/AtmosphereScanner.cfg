			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = The sensor begins to detect traces of Nitrogen, Carbon, and Oxygen before the heat from entry begins to fudge the readings.
				FlyingLow = The sensor reads: 83% Elemental Nitrogen (N2) / 14% Carbon Monoxide (CO) / 2% Elemental Krypton (Kr) / ~0.5% Elemental Argon (Ar) / ~0.5% Osmium Tetroxide / TRACE% Elemental Neon (Ne) / TRACE% Elemental Xenon (Xe) / TRACE% Elemental Oxygen (O2) / TRACE% Ozone (O3) / TRACE% Elemental Mercury Vapor(Hg) / TRACE% Elemental Radon (Rn)
				SrfLanded = The sensor reads: 83% Elemental Nitrogen (N2) / 14% Carbon Monoxide (CO) / 2% Elemental Krypton (Kr) / ~0.5% Elemental Argon (Ar) / ~0.5% Osmium Tetroxide / TRACE% Elemental Neon (Ne) / TRACE% Elemental Xenon (Xe) / TRACE% Elemental Oxygen (O2) / TRACE% Ozone (O3) / TRACE% Elemental Mercury Vapor(Hg) / TRACE% Elemental Radon (Rn)
				SrfSplashed = The sensor begins to only read Carbon Monoxide, Krypton, and Argon as it dips into the supercritical "liquid."

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Jones
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = The sensor detects Hydrogen and Oxygen, though this is perplexing since this body is too small to hold on to either of these.
				FlyingLow = The sensor reads: 100% Water Vapor (H2O). This water vapor can only be here from sublimation of the ice, and constantly needs to be replenished, or else the atmosphere would disappear in months. This is why there aren't even detectable trace gasses in this atmosphere, as Jones can't hold onto any.
