		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Sinacin
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Looking down, you see the clouds whizzing by at break-neck speeds. Mission control assures you everything will be okay, but it is hard to trust them when you are in a fragile little capsule as Kraken-only-knows lies below you...
				InSpaceHigh = The beauty of this system only just now begins to dawn on you. You have always seen the pictures from telescopes in textbooks; however, seeing the dance of the two outer-moons around the binary titans below them, in person, is an experience one could only dream about.
				FlyingHigh = You are beginning to see some plasma form outside of your craft as you enter Sinacin's atmosphere. Even if the window wasn't covered in fire, its unlikely you would be able to see any surface features as you are still well above the clouds, somehow.
				FlyingLow = You can barely breathe. It is nearly impossible to even see straight the gee forces are so intense. You muster enough strength to turn your head and see out the window. You see nothing but fog. If only your neck was strong enough to crane down and see the surface below. 
				SrfLanded = Why mission control is having us land here is an enigma. No amount of high gee training could have ever prepared you for this. Standing up is like deadlifting an entire gym, but you somehow managae to do it. You stumble your way over to the craft window, barely keeping conciousness as your heart struggles to pump blood to your head. Looking out the window, the surface is a shiny sand full of heavy metal fragments, kind of like glitter. Although seeing something no one else could ever see is enamouring, you wonder if this craft is actually capable of escaping. You suddenly fall back down as your knees give way, bumping your head on the window. You lie down, trying to regain any sort of sense as to what is going on. You start to panic, the world is beginning to spin, and you start to fade in and out fo conciousness. It is getting cold, and we are running out of snacks...
				SrfSplashed = Why mission control is having us land here is an enigma. No amount of high gee training could have ever prepared you for this. Standing up is like deadlifting an entire gym, but you somehow managae to do it. You stumble your way over to the craft window, barely keeping conciousness as your heart struggles to pump blood to your head and the craft bobs up and down in whatever liquid this is. Looking out the window, the ocean is beautiful and kind of foggy, unlike anything you have ever seen. Although seeing something no one else could ever see is enamouring, you wonder if this craft is actually capable of escaping. You suddenly fall back down as the craft violently bobs upwards, bumping your head on the window. You lie down, trying to regain any sort of sense as to what is going on. You start to panic, the world is beginning to spin, and you start to fade in and out fo conciousness. It is getting cold, and we are running out of snacks...

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Rangon
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Being in a low orbit, you notice just how fast Rangon is spinning under you. You try not to look down, or else the snacks you devoured earlier might be un-devoured.
				InSpaceHigh = Now being inside of its sphere of influence, you notice just how ragged the terrain is. How are we supposed to land on this again?
				SrfLanded = Looking at Sinacin from the surface of Rangon is terrifying. You are moving so fast! You don't think you have the courage to step outside.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Glice
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The striking blue clouds dancing around the massive storm facing Sinacin is truely a sight to behold... through your dusty spacecraft window. Who's turn is it to clean this?
				InSpaceHigh = Seeing this terrifyingly huge Ice Giant being flung around and bullied by Sinacin through your telescope your whole life, and now finally being able to see Glice's side of the story, is very humbling.
				FlyingHigh = If only the entry plasma wasn't so ferocious, you imagine the clouds look great from here.
				FlyingLow = The gee forces are quite comfortable surprisingly; however, with the atmospheric pressure increasing even more, you start to hear creaks and cracks throughout the craft. The light through the window is beginning to fade as the atmosphere thickens. It's best to return to space now.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Caua
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The purple ancient sea beds blend in beautifully with the puffy white snow, dotted with sinkholes throughout. You want to go down there and explore, it seems rather inviting compared to the rest of the Sinacin-system.
				InSpaceHigh = Looking down from up here, Caua seems like a rather comforting world. You have never seen a rectangular moon before. The colors are very vivid and pretty, you notice. It also looks very delicious for some reason. Oh wait, that's just your snack wrapper floating infront of the window.
				FlyingHigh = The plasma is a very pretty color, you haven't seen this color since you re-entered over Armstrong.
				FlyingLow = You look out the window and see little snowflakes hovering next to you! Oh right, they are just falling at around the same speed. Hopefully the the snow braces your fall.
				SrfLanded = You look out the window to observe the beautiful terrain. Oh wait, its all white?! It looked so much better from orbit! (you fail to realize there is just snow covering the window)
				SrfSplashed = How the hell did you get to the subsurface ocean? You sly dog. Baconator.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Alia
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The mountains are easily seen from this altitude, and are strikingly beautiful with their blueish-white color. They pierce sky magnificently. 
				InSpaceHigh = The red, white, and blue accents of Alia blend beautifully with the terrain. You wonder if there is any oil down there...
				SrfLanded = You look out the window at the barren terrain awaiting your footstep. This world has existed for billions of years, untouched by life, and you are about to OH LOOK JONES IS OVERHEAD!!!!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Jones
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = This little doofus is so cute, you honestly can't take it. Just LOOK at those little bumps and hills!!!! It looks so fun to just jump around in that low gravity. It's easy to forget this little lad has had such a violent past...  
				InSpaceHigh = You look out the window and think notice that this little sub-moon is SUCH a goober. Undeniably. Let's get a closer look. 
				FlyingHigh = You look at the gauges on the screen and notice you are decelerating. Wait, this little man has an ATMOSPHERE???
				FlyingLow = You are still in disbelief that there is noticable air pressure. It would be really fun to fly a plane here. 
				SrfLanded = You look at the icy surface awaiting you, and are very excited to mess around out there.
