		{
			name = PJ2/Sinacin
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Being in the vacuum of space, you can only measure the tempurature of the craft. The craft is quite cold on the side facing away from Phosphol and Vespol, as the light from Pyri is barely noticable. 
				InSpaceLow = Being in the vacuum of space, you can only measure the tempurature of the craft. The craft is noticiably warmer this close to Sinacin than it is higher up, as the radiation from the lower Sinacinal radiation belt is bombarding it.
				FlyingHigh = The thermometer is maxing out as the plasma from entry is thousands of degrees.
				FlyingLow = It is very cold down here, but the readings are scewed because the residual heat from entry.
				SrfLandedIrridiated_Flats = The air is extremely cold, colder than theorized. Most likely due to the highly reflective naturee of the clouds.
				SrfSplashed = This supercritical fluid is extremely cold, and was not anticipated to be here as the tempuratures were theorized to be warmer.

				InSpaceLow = Being in the vacuum of space, you can only measure the tempurature of the craft. The craft is noticiably warmer this close to Sinacin than it is higher up, as the radiation from the lower Sinacin radiation belt is bombarding it.
				InSpaceHigh = Being in the vacuum of space, you can only measure the tempurature of the craft. The craft is noticiably warmer this close to Sinacin than it is higher up, as the radiation from the lower Sinacin radiation belt is bombarding it.
				SrfLandedDusty_Highlands = Being in a vacuum, you can only measure the tempurature of the surface. The surface of Rangon is slightly warmer than solar insolation data from this distance would suggest, but that is likely because it is constantly bombarded by Sinacin's lower belt radiation.
				SrfLandedDusty_Lowlands = Being in a vacuum, you can only measure the tempurature of the surface. The surface of Rangon down here is colder than it is in the mountain tops, as they provide some shade and shielding from some radiation.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Glice
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Being in the vacuum of space, you can only measure the tempurature of the craft. The craft is noticiably warmer this close to Glice than it is higher up, as the radiation from the lower Glician radiation belt is bombarding it.
				InSpaceHigh = Being in the vacuum of space, you can only measure the tempurature of the craft. The craft is quite cold on the side facing away from Phosphol and Vespol, as the light from Pyri is barely noticable.
				FlyingHigh = The thermometer is maxing out as the plasma from entry is thousands of degrees.
				FlyingLowSinacinal_Storms = The tempurature here is slightly warmer than the rest of Glice, as the friction from the insane winds keeps this area a few degrees above average.
				FlyingLowFrigid_Winds = The winds of Glice are extremely cold, as they are carrying cold air into the storm to replace the rising hot air.
				FlyingLowAnti-Sinacinal_Calm = The atmosphere here is colder than most of the planet, but there isn't much wind. 
				FlyingLowNorthern_Clouds = It is cold here, of course, but not as cold as one may think for an ice giant's poles. The aurorae keep the tempurature here above equilibrium, but due to a slight mismatch between magnetic north pole and geographic north pole, it is slightly colder here than the south pole.
				FlyingLowSouthern_Clouds = It is cold here, of course, but not as cold as one may think for an ice giant's poles. The aurorae keep the tempurature here above equilibrium, but due to a slight mismatch between magnetic north pole and geographic north pole, it is slightly warmer here than the north pole.
				SrfLanded = AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Caua
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Being in the vacuum of space, you can only measure the tempurature of the craft. The craft is noticiably warmer this close to Caua than it is higher up, as the radiation from the lower Cauian radiation belt is bombarding it.
				InSpaceHigh = Being in the vacuum of space, you can only measure the tempurature of the craft. The craft is quite cold on the side facing away from Phosphol and Vespol, as the light from Pyri is barely noticable.
				FlyingHigh = The thermometer is maxing out as the plasma from entry is thousands of degrees.
				FlyingLow = The atmosphere here is cold, wait, it's warm? Why is it now warm? What?! (a flake of snow landed on the thermometer and melts due to the radiant heat of the craft, which in turn masses with the thermometer reading)
				SrfLandedSnowy_Midlands = It is extremely cold here. A kerbal could only survive for less than a minute without a helmet on, despite Caua having a breathable atmosphere.
				SrfLandedAncient_Iodized_Lakebeds = It is extremely cold here, though slightly warmer than the rest of the moon at this low altitude. Even still, a kerbal could only survive for less than a minute without a helmet on, before freezing to death.
				SrfLandedAncient_Rivers = It is extremely cold here, though slightly warmer than the rest of the moon at this low altitude. Even still, a kerbal could only survive for less than a minute without a helmet on, before freezing to death.
				SrfLandedVolcano_Basin = The air here is more still than the rest of this world, and is thus slightly warmer. Also, the snow here is ever-so slightly warmer than it is elsewhere, this volcano may not be extinct after all...
				SrfLandedVolcano_Rim = The air here is an extreme cold, one of the coldest places on this moon. A kerbal would freeze to death in tens of seconds without their helmet. 
				SrfLandedVolcano_Flank = It is extremely cold here. A kerbal could only survive for less than a minute without a helmet on, despite Caua having a breathable atmosphere.
				SrfLandedRocky_Mountain-Tops = It is deadly cold here, and the winds are violent. A kerbal could only survive for seconds without their helmet

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Alia
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Being in the vacuum of space, you can only measure the tempurature of the craft. The craft is very slightly warmer this close to Alia than it is higher up, as the radiation from the miniscule lower Alian radiation belt is pelting it.
				InSpaceHigh = Being in the vacuum of space, you can only measure the tempurature of the craft. The craft is quite cold on the side facing away from Phosphol and Vespol, as the light from Pyri is barely noticable.
				SrfLanded = Being in a vacuum, you can only measure the tempurature of the surface. The tempurature of this moon is basically the same everywhere. Even though there is ice on the higher elevations, it is the same tempurature as the rocks in the lower altitudes. Now what exactly is that tempurature? Cold. Very Cold.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Jones
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Being in the vacuum of space, you can only measure the tempurature of the craft. The craft is very slightly warmer this close to Alia than it is higher than Jones' orbit, as the radiation from the miniscule lower Alian radiation belt is pelting it.
				InSpaceHigh = Being in the vacuum of space, you can only measure the tempurature of the craft. The craft is very slightly warmer this close to Alia than it is higher than Jones' orbit, as the radiation from the miniscule lower Alian radiation belt is pelting it.
				FlyingHigh = The exosphere is extremely thin, so it is very hard to get the tempurature. What little than can be detected paints a picture of a very cold atmosphere.
				FyingLow = As the upper atmopshere report suggested, it is exremely cold down here.
				SrfLanded = The tempurature all around Jones is the same, extremely cold. The ground is made of ice, what do you expect?
