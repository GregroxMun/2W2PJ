		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Sinacin
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Not even the faintest of pressure is detected this far out.
				InSpaceLow = The pressure guage seems to move a tiny amount, and you tap it just to be sure it isn't an erroneous reading. It shows a few picopascals, at the absolute limit of the guages detection abilities. This means Rangon will probably crash into Sinacin in the next few 100 million years due to the drag.
				FlyingHigh = You begin to get a reading, but it is skewed by the dynamic pressure from your entry.
				FlyingLow = The guage is reading a quickly increasing level of pressure as you fall.
				SrfLanded = The pressure varries greatly even with only a few meters of elevation difference.
				SrfSplashed = The pressure is very high, at about 1.5 megapascals. This is around 250 times higher than Armstrong's pressure at sea level.

				InSpaceHigh = The pressure guage seems to move a tiny amount, and you tap it just to be sure it isn't an erroneous reading. It shows a few picopascals, at the absolute limit of the guages detection limit. This means Rangon will probably crash into Sinacin in the next few 100 million years.
				InSpaceLow = The pressure guage seems to read between 10-100 picopascals, most likely from dust that is kicked off of the surface.
				SrfLandedDusty_Highlands = The guage reads random values from between 10-300 picopascals, most likely due to dust kicked off of Rangon's surface by radiation.
				SrfLandedDusty_Lowlands = The guage reads values between 0-10 picopascals. The value is less than that of the mountains and highlands, and around the same pressure as the space above Sinacin. This is probably because the lower elevations are partially shielded from radiation by mountain-tops and crater peaks. The radiation is what causes the dust to become dislodged from the surface, and thus without it, disallows  'airborne' dust.

				InSpaceHigh = Not even the faintest of pressure is detected.
				InSpaceLow = The pressure guage seems to move a tiny amount. It shows a few nanopascals, which although is higher than anticipated, has zero effect on your craft.
				FlyingHigh = You begin to get a reading, but it is skewed by the dynamic pressure from your entry.
				FlyingLow = The reading steadly increases as you descend in altitude.

			Values

				InSpaceHigh = Not even the faintest of pressure is detected.
				InSpaceLow = The pressure guage seems to move a tiny amount. It shows between 10-100 nanopascals, though it isn't enough to have any effect on your craft.
				FlyingHigh = You begin to get a reading, but it is skewed by the dynamic pressure from your entry.
				FlyingLow = The pressures here would be very comfortable, and are very similar to the pressures used inside your crew capsules.
				SrfLandedSnowy_Midlands = The pressure here is slightly higher than 100 kilopascals, which is the normal pressure inside of crew capsules. Though, it would be easy to adjust with a few ear pops and pieces of gum.
				SrfLandedAncient_Iodized_Lakebeds = The pressure here is a bit below 200 kilopascals, close to double the pressure you are used to inside of crew capsules. Although it may take a while to adjust, should you have to live at this pressure, but it wouldn't be impossible.
				SrfLandedAncient_Rivers = The pressure here is a bit below 200 kilopascals, close to double the pressure you are used to inside of crew capsules. Although it may take a while to adjust, should you have to live at this pressure, but it wouldn't be impossible.
				SrfLandedVolcano_Basin = The pressures here would be very comfortable, and are very similar to the pressures used inside your crew capsules.
				SrfLandedVolcano_Rim = The pressure here is pretty low compared to the rest of the world, but still much higher than those found on Armstrong.
				SrfLandedVolcano_Flank = The pressures here would be very comfortable, and are very similar to the pressures used inside your crew capsules.
				Rocky_Mountain-Tops = The pressure here is pretty low compared to the rest of the world, but still much higher than those found on Armstrong.

				InSpaceHigh = Not even the faintest of pressure is detected.
				InSpaceLow = The pressure guage seems to move a tiny amount. It shows between 10-100 picopascals, which is less than anticipated. Because of this very low exospheric pressure, Jones will probably be stable for a few billion years, at least, before decaying.
				SrfLandedMidlands = The guage detecs a few nanopascals of pressure, which is not enough to effect your craft. This exopshere is probably made of sublimated ice.
				SrfLandedLowlands = The guage is barely able to detect anything, with pressure ranging from 0-100 picopascals. The pressure is decreasing with decreasing altitude, which is extremely peculiar.
				SrfLandedAncient_Lava_Chasm = The guage detects nothing, not even a single picopascal. This means the pressure is on the order of femtopascals, quadrillionths of a pascal, and thus below the guages detection range. This helps lend credence to the theory that the amount of ice in the ground at a certain area on Alia is positively correlated with the exospheric pressure. Having nearly no ice, the pressure is approaching zero.
				SrfLandedSmooth_Plateau = It reads between 10-300 nanopascals of pressure. Not enough to effect your craft in the slightest.
				SrfLandedRugged_Midlands = It reads between 100-700 nanopascals of pressure. Not enough to effect your craft in the slightest.
				SrfLandedHighlands = The guage reads a surprisingly high 1-10 micropascals! Although not high enough to effect your craft in any way at all, this helps lend credence to the theory that the amount of ice in the ground at a certain area on Alia is positively correlated with the exospheric pressure. Having a lot of ice, the pressure here is higher than most other areas on Alia.
				SrfLandedAncient_Impact_Crater-Cano = It reads between 50-400 nanopascals of pressure. Not enough to effect your craft in the slightest.
				SrfLandedAncient_Lava_Flow = The guage detects 0-10 picopascals, probably this low because of the relatively low ice content in this area of Alia.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Jones
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The pressure guage seems to move a tiny amount. It shows between 50-200 picopascals. This is slightly higher than the ambient pressure around Alia at this altitude.
				InSpaceLow = The guage is able to detect up to a few nanopascals even at this altitude, this little man must be sublimating a lot of ice!
				FlyingHigh = The guage begins to detect a sharp increase in pressure, going from nanopascals, to micropascals, to milipascals in only a few kilometers.
				FlyingLow = The pressure is now in the order of pascals, wow, Jones is an angry little ball of ice!
				SrfLandedIcy_Midlands = The pressure is around 50-100 pascals here, and has a noticable effect on your craft. 
				SrfLandedIcy_Lowlands = The pressure is approaching 0.5 kilopascals, and combined with the low gravity, would make it decently easy to fly here.
