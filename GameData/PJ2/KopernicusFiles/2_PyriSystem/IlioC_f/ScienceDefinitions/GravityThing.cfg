	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Sinacin
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The sensor is nearly overloaded. The oppressive, destructive, and extreme gravitational field is trying its hardest to pull you in.
				InSpaceHigh = The gravity scanner detects a massive pair of bodies, warping and stretching their combined gravitational fields as they dance around each other.
				SrfLanded = The sensor struggles to maintain an accurate reading, much less able to find caves and cracks below you. The gravity is lethal here, never send a crewed mission to the surface, even if you are somehow capable of returning. 
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Rangon
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The sensor detects an extremely slight disturbance from the normal gravitational field of Sinacin.
				InSpaceHigh = The sensor detects an extremely slight disturbance from the normal gravitational field of Sinacin.
				SrfLanded = The sensor detects negative gravity nearly everywhere on the surface, and it is thus impossible to try and map the internal features of Rangon; though, it is unlikely you are missing out on anything.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Glice
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The sensor detects a smooth gravitational field below it.
				InSpaceHigh = The sensor begins to focus on Glice, as Glice's gravity is now relatively stronger than Sinacin's at this location.
				SrfLanded = Bro are u on cuh rn?
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Caua
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The sensor detects a mostly smooth surface with a large mountain range to the north.
				InSpaceHigh = The sensor begins to detect a major disturbance in the Sinicanal-Glicean gravitational field, and turns its attention over to Caua.
				SrfLanded = The gravity here would be extremely comfortable for a Kerbal, more-so than even Armstrong. The sensor also gets direct confirmation of a subsurface ocean, with a rocky crust below that. The only spot on Caua that doesn't have a subsurface ocean below it is the northern mountains, which protrude directly from the crust, through the ice.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Alia
			{
				InSpaceLow = The sensor detects a relatviely weak, but pertinent gravitational field. Although weaker than Armstrong's, it is most certainly not ignorable.
				InSpaceHigh = The sensor only just now begins to detect Alia's modest gravitational field. It also detects a small disturbance at egular intervals closer to the surface...
				SrfLanded = The gravity here would be really fun to jump around in. The sensor also notices a multitude of lava tubes and caves below the surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Jones
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The sensor detects a near perfect sphere of water-density matter below it.
				InSpaceHigh = The sensor begins to detect a major disturbance in the local Alian gravitational field.
				SrfLanded = With how low the gravity is, it would be very easy to fly here, even under arm power! The sensor also confirmes the presence of a subsurface ocean with similar density to that of iodine-salt water.
