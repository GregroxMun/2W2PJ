		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Sinacin
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The boom detetcs an extremely strong magnetic field that funnels radiation into a lethal lower belt for both lifeforms and computers.
				InSpaceHigh = The magnetic field from both Sinacin and Glice can be detected from here, it is stronger than initially expected. These readings suggest the magnetotail of Bifrost could have connection events with the Sinacinal and Glician magentosphere, creating high energy events. 
				SrfLanded = The sensor detects a very strong magnetic field protecting the surface from outside radiation.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Rangon
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The boom detects that Sinacin's magnetic field is noticably distorted around Rangon.
				InSpaceHigh = The boom detects that Sinacin's magnetic field is noticably distorted around Rangon.
				SrfLanded = The sensor notices that Rangon has a sizable induced magnetic field, most likely originating from the radiation it is constantly being bombared by in the lower Sinacinal belt. The leading theory is that the radiation strips many of the Platinum and Iridium atoms on its surface of their electrons and makes them charged. Though, this small induced magnetic field is not strong enough to protect anything on its surface from the lethal radiation.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Glice
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The boom detetcs an extremely strong magnetic field that funnels radiation into a lethal lower belt for both lifeforms and computers.
				InSpaceHigh = Here, the magneto-evironment is dominated by Glice, and Glice forms two sizable radiation belts. 
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Caua
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The boom detects a magnetic field similar to that of Armstrong. Strong and noticable, capable of protecting the surface below it. This also indicates an active interior. It also produces the relatively dangerous lower Cauian radiation belt.
				InSpaceHigh = A faint disturbance in the Sinacinal-Glician magnetic field is detected here. Let's get closer.
				SrfLanded = The sensor detects a normal terrestrial magnetic field protecting the surface from most outside radiation.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Alia
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The boom notices a weak magnetic field creating a small radiation belt. This magnetic field is too strong to be purely induced, indicating a somewhat active interior, but still far weaker than that of Sinacin's and Glice's, even at this distance.
				InSpaceHigh = The boom only detects the Sinacinal-Glicean magnetic field from out here.
				SrfLanded = The very weak magnetic field is not enough to protect the surface from much radiation, over 98% still makes it through. Though, it is noticable, indicating a weakly active interior.

		Body
		{
			name = PJ2/Jones
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Only the Sinacinal, Glicean, and faint Alian magnetic field is detected here.
				InSpaceHigh = Only the Sinacinal, Glicean, and faint Alian magnetic field is detected here.
				SrfLanded = Only the Sinacinal, Glicean, and faint Alian magnetic field is detected here. It is unlikely Jones is geologically active, sans rare cryo-volcanism.
