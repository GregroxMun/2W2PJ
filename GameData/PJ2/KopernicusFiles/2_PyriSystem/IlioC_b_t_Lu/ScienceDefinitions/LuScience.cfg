		LuInSpaceHigh = Lu is a two-toned world. The lighter highlands appear orange under Pyrilight and slightly yellow-gray in Ilioshine, while the flat lowlands which occupy most of the Synpyrian side appear distinctly purple in coloration.
		LuInSpaceLow = You search around for a nice, flat landing site. Though the craters are to be avoided, there are several large flats that would make good, if boring, landing sites. You suppose it's the more rugged sites that are the most interesting to explore.

		LuNightRayCraters = The sample has a mafic composition which is similar to but isotopically subtly distinct from rocks making up Armstrong's mantle. Mixed into the regolith are small microscopic glass beads, quich are quite pretty.

There are some volcanic rocks mixed in with a highly metallic impurity, giving it a somewhat purple coloration.

		LuOldBasins = The sample has a primarily mafic composition which is similar to but isotopically subtly distinct from rocks making up Armstrong's mantle. There are some volcanic rocks mixed in. These rocks are heavily weathered, quite dark, and overlain by other materials, indicating this is an especially old part of the planet.
		
		LuNearOcean = The sample is composed of basaltic rocks with a high concentration of metallic impurity which gives it a purple coloration.
		LuRecentLava = The sample is composed of basaltic rocks with a high concentration of metallic impurity which gives it a purple coloration. The color is quite bright and reflective, and its isotopic ratios are different than in the surrounding terrain, indicating that it is geologically recent.

		LuFarsideBasinMountains = Some fragments of material sampled are unusually dense for their chemical structure, by near exactly one order of magnitude. It’s unclear what this is caused by, potentially the heat and pressure environment this impact briefly produced had incredible compression power? But running the numbers, had that been true this impact would’ve been incredibly strong, so much so that it should’ve destroyed Lu entirely.

It’s unclear what this is caused by, potentially the heat and pressure environment this impact briefly produced had incredible compression power? But running the numbers, had that been true this impact would’ve been incredibly strong, so much so that it should’ve destroyed Lu entirely.

		LuOverlainFarsideBasin = The sample has a primarily mafic composition which is similar to but isotopically subtly distinct from rocks making up Armstrong's mantle. Mixed in with some very old rocks are some ejecta from Mare Nova. You try to pick up one of the brighter, more recent pebbles, but it's so heavy it slips out of your glove. What?

		LuSrfLandedBasinMountains = At the instant of contact with the Luar surface, you felt a spark- but there was no flame. It was more like a spark inside your mind, an impulse- probably not a directed one. You feel you will have to ruminate on this for a while yet.
		LuFarsideBasinFloor = As you stare across the plains of Lu's newest large basin, you feel... something. Not a voice in your head, not even a whisper in your head- the ghost of a voice, maybe. Was there intent behind it? The sensation is fading fast, like a dream after waking. Was it ever even there? Surely not.
		LuFarsideBasinBlanket = Do you feel slightly heavier than normal, or is it just the suit?

		LuInSpaceFarsideBasinFloor = Gravioli scans of Novum Planitia suggest that at the center of the basin there lies a mass concentration. Something seems off about it- is it just your imagination, or is it more localized than the others? Perhaps the impactor was made of iron, and stayed relatively intact....
		LuInSpace = Mapping mass concentrations on Lu.
		LuInSpaceNearOcean = Oceanus Caldor seems to have covered up several major impact basins. There's an entirely hidden chain of three impact basins indicated in the mass concentration.
