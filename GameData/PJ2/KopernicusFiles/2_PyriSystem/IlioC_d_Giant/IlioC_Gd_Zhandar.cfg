			description = Zhandar is a gas giant planet orbiting Pyri at such a distance that it might actually be comfortable to live at, for a change. The discovery that it was made in large part of hydrogen and helium helped bolster the ancient and well-respected theory that the universe is made up of concentric shells orbiting a Central Fire, made of lightweight ethereal matter that doesn't unbalance the cosmos too much. The fact that all that lightweight, ethereal hydrogen gas added up to be more than a dozen times heavier than Armstrong was, somehow, considered unimportant. Unfortunately, due to its water and hydrogen-rich composition, Zhandar doesn't actually have a surface you could land at and walk on, so mission planners see it instead as a huge mass that a spacecraft could do a gravity assist off of. \nSuch trans-Zhandar trajectories would allow access to the rest of the Pyri system, and even the Ilio system, with considerably less rocket fuel than if it were avoided altogether.\n-Luna
