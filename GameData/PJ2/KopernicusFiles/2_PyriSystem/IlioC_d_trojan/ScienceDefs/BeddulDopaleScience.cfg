		DopaleInSpace = You look down on the beautiful, deep-blue world below you. It looks idyllic, almost a paradise. At least, from here.
		DopaleSrfSplashed = So, you thought you could go sailing on another planet, did ya? You thought that if you just went to space FIRST, you'd technically be playing a space game, huh? You thought you could get away with playing pretend at being a boat captain if you just went the long way around, huh? Well you\n\nWOULD BE RIGHT! I'm so happy you're sailing on a planet that ISN'T Armstrong! Congrats on merging your freakish, disgusting obsession with marine environments with your obligation to do the bare minimum as a space program.
		
		BeddulInSpace = What mysteries lie beneath Beddul's mysterious cloud cover? Could it be an ocean world, like its twin? Or might it be a disappointing lacustrine world with barely any water? Could it be a gas dwarf? You really hope it's not a gas dwarf.

		DopaleSrfSplashed = You go for a nice swim in Dopale's waves.

		DopaleSrfLanded = Comfortable gravity, comfortable pressure, comfortable temperature... all it needs is oxygen to breathe and it'd be a paradise.
		
		BeddulSrfLanded = Your space suit was designed to survive in higher temperatures than this, such as those found on Armstrong's Pyri-facing hemisphere. It is however a space suit, which means it was designed to withstand somewhere between zero and zero point six eight atmospheres.

		DopaleSrfSplashedDeepOcean = The ocean is highly acidic, with a saturation of what appears to be volcanic ash. Curious, as there isn't much of anything in the way of ash in the sky!
		DopaleSrfSplashedShallowSeas = The ocean is highly acidic, with a high concentration of what appears to be volcanic ash. Curious, as there isn't much of anything in the way of ash in the sky. Remarkably, your sample seems to contain evidence of ongoing biochemistry!
		DopaleSrfLandedShallowSeas = You hope to find a sea shell in the sand, but all you find is boring silicate rock particles, although it does react to the biosignature experiment!
		DopaleSrfLandedIslands = The sample is granitic sand, rich in aluminium silicates.
		DopaleSrfLandedVolcanoes = The sample is a basaltic volcanic rock. Go figure.
		DopaleSrfLandedMountains = The sample is a hard chunk of granitic rock.
		
		BeddulSrfLanded = This sample is covered in a thin layer of dust and volcanic ash, but is mostly made of layers of basaltic rock.
		BeddulSrfLandedEqVolcano = This sample seems to be made up of an extremely young volcanic rock, in that it is still glowing dimly and you should probably put it down!
		BeddulSrfLandedSVolcano = This sample seems to be made up of a geologically young volcanic rock.

		DopaleSrfLanded = Dopale's surface is, unsurprisingly, quite temperate, though it's a little on the warm side.
		BeddulSrfLanded = The thermometer, which is built to withstand even temperature found on Armstrong's pyri-facing side, manages to stay in one piece, although the corrosion might be a greater issue.

		DopaleSrfLanded = Based upon considerations such as altitude above sea level and the scale height of the atmosphere, a sea level atmospheric pressure can be derived. 115.57 kPa, 1.14 Kerbin Atmospheres, or 17 times the atmospheric pressure of Armstrong. Fun fact: this atmosphere is thick enough that if exposed to it, your blood would stay right where it is, in your veins, for a change!
		BeddulSrfLanded = Based upon considerations such as altitude above sea level and the scale height of the atmosphere, a sea level atmospheric pressure can be derived. 1323.4 Kpa, 13.06 Kerbin Atmospheres, or 195 times the pressure of Armstrong's atmosphere. You can't help but find that value a little... smothering.
		BeddulSrfLandedMountains = Even at this altitude, the atmospheric pressure is a smothering 9 atmospheres.

		Beddul-Dopale_BarycenterInSpace = The magnetic field of both Beddul and Dopale are extremely strong, and seem to almost reinforce one another, as they share a common magnetopause.
		BeddulInSpace = Beddul's magnetic field appears to be the weaker half of the magnetic field environment, indicating a sub-optimal ratio of molten to solid iron in its core.
		DopaleInSpace = Dopale's magnetic field is extremely strong, indicating a powerful magnetic dynamo in its core.

		BeddulSrfLanded = At least a small amount of seismic activity is a constant on Beddul. This is useful as it does provide an easy means of determining Beddul's inner structure.
		BeddulSrfLandedEqVolcano = The ground shakes beneath you. This location is NOT stable--and you're pretty sure you don't need a highly precise seismometer to determine that!
		BeddulSrfLandedSVolcano = The ground doesn't really seem to be especially stable here.
		
		DopaleSrfLanded = The sensor registers a small micro-quake. Let no one say Dopale is dead inside.
		DopaleSrfLandedVolcanoes = The ground doesn't really seem to be especially stable here.
		DopaleSrfSplashed = The ground is moving up and down in large sweeping motions--this is some of the most dramatic earthquakes ever seen, or even theorized! What a terrifying planet--oh. It's ocean waves.

		DopaleSrfSplashed = The goo container's reinforcements are holding, at least well enough to prevent the goo from escaping into the water. For now. The goo seems to be perfectly happy here, and is developing a green coloration to take advantage of a photosynthetic metabolism in the low-oxygen, high-CO2 environment.
		DopaleSrfLanded = The goo seems to be perfectly happy here, and is developing a green coloration to take advantage of a photosynthetic metabolism in the low-oxygen, high-CO2 environment.
		BeddulSrfLanded = The goo begins to bubble. It shrivels up as moisture leaves it at much too high a rate. It tries to create a protective rubbery shell, but this won't last long, as the corrosive vapors in the atmosphere attack this temporary skin.
