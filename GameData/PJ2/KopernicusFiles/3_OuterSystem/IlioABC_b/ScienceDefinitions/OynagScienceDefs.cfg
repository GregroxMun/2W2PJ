				InSpaceHigh = You can already feel Oynag's gaze upon you. Your craft is now within its grasp, and already its swirling chaotic moon system can be made out. You've stumbled into a very strange neighborhood, and you hope to be granted safe passage.
				InSpaceLow = Oynag looms out the window, and you can't help but feel like you need to hide from it. You're at the heart of a gravitational domain defined by chaos all the way from Oynag's cloud tops to Cricoid's surface. Its exploration will not be trivial.
				FlyingHigh = You hold on to your seat and pray to a deity of your choice. You plead with Oynag not to strike you down, as you are a well-meaning voyager flying through its skies in the spirit of exploration. Your cries of course fall on deaf ears. May physics and good math have mercy upon you.
				FlyingLow = Is this it? Is this the end? Oynag was a monstrous being of consumption and gluttony in legend. Perhaps there is some truth to said legends.

			name = PJ2/Oynag
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = It's as if some great celestial being fell and the myriad worlds it was carrying were scattered across the sky aimlessly. There is no one "plane" of the Oynag Mess, moons finds themselves occupying whatever orbits the eccentric, captive, giant world Atrium throws them into. It's almost as if Atrium is protesting its capture within Oynag's gravity well.
				InSpaceLow = You feel like you should get back into the hatch, adrenalin is coursing through your viens. It's as if you're out in the open and exposed to some horrible being to which you are mere prey. You always feel like Oynag is looking directly at you.
				FlyingHigh = Twisting the tail of fate like this may be, risky.
				FlyingLow = You take a moment to reflect on this. Why did you come here? What was there to learn from Oynag's cloudscape that required that crew arrived in its skies? Was this *really* science that couldn't have been handled by some manner of robot, or non-sapient goo? Are you certain there's a way home from here, or are you sacrificed in the name of scientific pursuit? The lumpy horizon of swirling ammonia clouds rises higher and higher around you. You're being swallowed. Why?

				InSpaceHigh = It sure is cold this far out, even when Pyri is closest the situation wouldn't noticably improve.
				InSpaceLow = It sure is cold this far out, even when Pyri is closest the situation wouldn't noticably improve.
				FlyingHigh = The temperature picks up rapidly as you enter the upper atmosphere of Oynag!
				FlyingLow = As the craft descends, the temperature rises and falls as several cloud layers are passed through, including a water-habitable layer with fluffy white clouds. This does not in any way suggest Oynag has a life-haboring environment however.

				InSpaceLow = The air doesn't quite extend this far out, but you are getting closer.
				FlyingHigh = Feeling the air of a gas giant, rather intense!
				FlyingLow = Oynag's pressure systems are a mess! Storms rage in unpredictable configurations as internal heat bubbles to the surface free from the shackles of Coriolis.

			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Oynag's magnetic field has difficulty pressing back against the solar winds of Ilio and Pyri. Without the fast rotation usually expected of gas giants, Oynag's core cannot generate a magnetic field expected of a giant on its scale.
				InSpaceLow = The magnetometer suddenly begins to transmit very complex data. Initially it is feared that it may have broken, but it's quickly determined to be functioning fine. It seems Oynag had a surprise in store: a very convective mantle! Numerous large localized magnetic fields are being generated in parallel from various regions deep within Oynag's interior.

				InSpaceLow = The goo seems to get disoriented by Oynag's mess of a magnetic environment. 
				FlyingHigh = Oynag's lack of habitable conditions surprises no one. Unlike gooid lifeforms hailing from worlds like Mesbin, the greater goo mass and its fragments cannot subsist off of hydrogen.

		{
			name = PJ2/Oynag
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Some of the materials seem to respond to the radiation of Oynag, even at this distance. Their reactions are more minor than expected however. Oynag's slow rotation and by extention its weak magnetic field must have trouble maintaining strong radiation belts, but Jejunum's extreme volcanism seems to make up for that somewhat by providing plenty of ionized particles.
				InSpaceLow = A water sample is bubbling slightly, at extreme proximity to Oynag it seems radiation trapped by mantle-born local fields can break water down into its constituents.
				FlyingHigh = Ice samples begin to melt, the paint of the materials bay begins to warp, some crystaline samples begin to glow, various sand grains cover the bay as their container explodes. The footage might be enjoyed by more than just scientists!
				FlyingLow = As things heat up, the materials bay becomes hot to the touch, and in the high radiation enviroment, large flashes of bright light come from the salt samples in the bay as they react violently with the heat and radiation.
