        HidalgoFlyingLowMidlands = The moon's atmosphere is surprisingly clear below the cloudcover.
        HidalgoFlyingLowLakes = Orange skylight reflects off the mirror-like surface of the moon's lakes.
        HidalgoSrfLandedLakes = Most of the terrain surrounding the lakes is heavily faulted, possibly due to seasonal freeze-thaw cycles.

        HidalgoSrfLandedMidlands = The moon's surface is packed hard. You kneel down to get a closer look, but it's hard to see because of an orange film that's starting to form on your visor. You wipe it off with some difficulty.
        HidalgoSrfLandedLakes = Your boots squelch in the soil. You can see that some of the metal fittings on your suit are starting to corrode from exposure to the moon's atmosphere.
        HidalgoSrfSplashed = The water isn't very dense. It's hard to stay afloat!

        HidalgoSrfSplashed = The moon's lakes are found to be a mixture of water and ammonia with a eutectic freezing point of -90 degrees, close to the theoretical minimum.
        HidalgoSrfLanded = The moon's surface is a conglomerate of icy material held together by some sort of nitrogen-rich organic gunk.

	{
        HidalgoSrfLanded = Hidalgo is fairly seismically active, possibly due to its near-resonance with Hysnoon. Seismic data shows that Hidalgo probably has a subsurface ocean of liquid water.

        HidalgoFlying = Nitrogen oxides are detected.
        HidalgoSrfLanded = Approximately 1% of the moon's nitrogen atmosphere is comprised of colorless nitrogen tetroxide. The upper atmosphere is hot enough that a small portion of it converts to orange nitrogen dioxide, hence the moon's color.\n\nThe origin of Hidalgo's nitrogen oxides is unknown, but it's possible that they're generated by seasonal thunderstorms (although these have yet to be observed).
