        TobalkInSpaceHigh = Tobalk's lack of an atmosphere is unusual considering its large size. Turtlestar, by comparison, appears to have no shortage of gas.
        TobalkInSpaceLow = Turtlestar has a surpisingly low gravitational influence.

        TobalkInSpaceLow = You watch the craters zip by.
        TobalkSrfLanded = The ground is made of water-ice regolith. Rock dust is also present, but only in trace amounts.

        TobalkSrfLanded = All the rocks and soil around here look pretty much the same. You take a couple bulk samples at random.

	@RESULTS
	{
        TobalkInSpaceLow = Tobalk reflects much of the starlight that hits it back into space.

	@RESULTS
	{
        TobalkInSpaceLow = A thin atmosphere is detected.
        TobalkSrfLanded = A thin atmosphere of helium, carbon dioxide and methane is detected. The composition matches Turtlestar's atmosphere pretty closely, although Tobalk is enriched in lighter gases.

        TobalkSrfLanded = Tobalk is very seismically active, although its tectonics don't seem to manifest on the surface in any coherent way.

        TobalkSrfLanded = Gravity scans suggest that Tobalk is internally differentiated.
