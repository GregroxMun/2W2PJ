				InSpaceHigh = You report a very firm visual contact with the large moon as you cross into its SOI, and begin to think on the phrase "large moon." The Ilio-Pyri System almost seems strategically designed to make such a phrase absolutely meaningless. There are moons ranging from the insanely small, to dramatically more massive than Armstrong. There are moons that blur the line between large moons and binary planet. You ultimately decide that the phrase "large moon" is at best situationally sufficient, but at worst completely meaningless.
				InSpaceLow = You can't help but feel *slightly* disappointed, Whayt from afar seemed a world with massive sprawling oceans. However new data called "the view out the window" shows Whayt's true form: an arid desert occassionally broken up by boiling lakes.
				FlyingHigh = The thick atmosphere provides a medium appropriate for planes! You hope the atmospheric composition further facilitates this sort of tech.
				FlyingLow = Whayt's terrain provides plenty of intriguing relief, hopefully we're on track for a gentle landing.
				FlyingLowMountains = It would be very fun to bring a plane here, and not very fun to try and land here.
				SrfLanded = Safely on the ground, the view out the window brings historical visions of long-gone Kerbin to mind. You wonder how similar they may truly be.
				SrfSplashed = The craft is bobbing around on the waves. You'd be having a good time if the sea-sickness wasn't compounded with the first experience of gravity in a long time.

				InSpaceHigh = Floating very above Whayt, while Whayt floats very high above Kilna. Situation is nominal.
				InSpaceLow = It's as if someone crudely merged both sides of Armstrong into one continuous body. Why would someone do such a thing? 
				FlyingHigh = You aren't a plane, and you're very much in the sky right now. Hopefully you have your parachute on you.
				FlyingLow = Feeling the air and wind against your suit is fascinating, the heavier atmosphere is very tangable!
				SrfLanded = If it wasn't so hot, maybe you'd feel comfortable on Whayt without any suit protecting you.
				SrfSplashed = You are now an ingredient in the Whayt Soup. Congratusouption.

				InSpaceHigh = Space is at space-y temperatures. That is to say it's a vacuum and you can't really measure its temperature, but we're telling you this in a sassy way.
				InSpaceLow = Space is at space-y temperatures. That is to say it's a vacuum and you can't really measure its temperature, but we're telling you this in a sassy way.
				FlyingHigh = It's getting pretty hot already! Whayt is a steamworld, and this is consistent with examples of such planets. Reticulum, Imterril, Blorgo Maxima, as far as planets go, steamworlds are surprisingly familiar. If only our data on these past examples amounted to anything beyond vague recollections past down through generations. Especially Blorgo. We miss Blorgo.

				SrfSplashed = The lake is at its heat capacity, and hot steam rises from its surface.

				InSpaceHigh = Space is at space-y pressures. There is no pressure.
				InSpaceLow = Space is at space-y pressures. There is no pressure.
				FlyingHigh = You blink and accidently miss the point where the pressure passes one Armstrong Surface Pressure. Whayt seems to enjoy demonstrating its thick atmosphere.
				FlyingLow = Already seeing pressures comparable to and surpassing that of many ancestral homeworlds, and the lower you go the higher that pressure rises.
				SrfLanded = There's a vast amount of steam above you at this point.
				SrfSplashed = At sea level the vapor pressure is quite noticable.

			{
				InSpaceHigh = Whayt doesn't have a detecable magnetosphere at this distance.
				InSpaceLow = Whayt's magnetosphere reveals itself, but it's quite weak. Whayt slowly rotates once per lap around Kilna, as tidally locked worlds do. This means the internal molten materials of Whayt do not get swirlled around very much. Yeah sure that works as an explaination. surely you've seen a lot of slow rotating planet-sized magnetic field generating things by now, right?

				InSpaceLow = The goo displays a glimmer of optimism towards Whayt. And you need to stop attributing your feelings to the goo.
				FlyingHigh = As the goo is increasingly exposed to more and more of Whayt's atmosphere, its pressure, temperature, and moisture, it seems to grow more comfortable!
				FlyingLow = As the goo is increasingly exposed to more and more of Whayt's atmosphere, its pressure, temperature, and moisture, it seems to grow more comfortable!
				SrfLanded = The pressure, temperature, and moisture are a bit high, but the goo seems to be able to survive on Whayt without much help!
				SrfSplashed = The goo seems to actually- oh. Oh. Well. It's boiled to death. How informative.
