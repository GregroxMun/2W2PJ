        ConscienceSrfLandedHighlands = The ridges in the planet's terrain seem to be tectonic in origin, but the cause of the radial patterns, particularly on the planet's far side, isn't clear.
        ConscienceSrfLandedBasins = Geological surveys suggest that the pitted areas of the moon's surface seem to be heavily-altered impact craters.

        ConscienceInSpaceHigh = Well, it's gray.

        ConscienceInSpaceLowHighlands = The planet's highlands are heavily striated and mostly free of impact craters.
        ConscienceInSpaceLowBasins = The pits in this part of the surface sort of resemble craters, but it's not clear if that's what they actually are.

        ConscienceSrfLanded = The surface is mostly loose rock, but some of the ground beneath is solid, as though it were formed recently.

        ConscienceInSpace = The moon possesses a sizable magnetic field for an object of its size.
        ConscienceSrfLanded = Conscience's magnetic field probably originates from tidally-induced convective currents in its core.
