        OluSrfLandedMidlands = Olu's trailing and leading sides have terrain resembling crumpled ridges; no doubt caused by tidal stretching.
        OluSrfLandedVolcanicFields = Volcanoes are abundant on the near and far sides of Olu.
        OluSrfLandedWhiteSpots = The material covering the ground on this part of the moon has no obvious specific origin.
        OluSrfLandedVolcanicPlumes = The purple material covering the ground on this part of the moon is centered on a large caldera.

        OluInSpace = The surface is mottled with greens, yellows, whites and purples.
        OluSrfLanded = The moon's surface is mostly dust. Looking closely, the grains are all different colors.

        OluSrfLandedMidlands = The surface colors are mostly from olivine and sulphur.
        OluSrfLandedVolcanicFields = The surface colors are mostly from olivine and sulphur.
        OluSrfLandedWhiteSpots = The white material on this part of the moon's surface is mostly table salt and gypsum in addition to smaller amounts of potassium salts.
        OluSrfLandedVolcanicPlumes = The pink material seems to be composed of anhydrous manganese and cobalt salts. The mechanism responsible for concentrating these metals isn't clear.
