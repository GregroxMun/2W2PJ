            // Soval's shape is a prolate ellipsoid with an aspect ratio of 3.5:1. Volume is 9.38e11 m^3. It's probably made of silicate rock with a density of 2600 kg/m^3, except it's only packed to 1/3rd of its volume so the actual density would be 870 kg/m^3. The mass therefore is 8.16e14 kg.
            
            // Soval is a little unrealistic. It probably ought to be somewhat oblate, and I don't believe it's dense enough to resist being roche'd by Ollo.

            displayName = Soval^N
            description = <color=#77b2ff>[So-vul.]</color> Precise observations of Ollo as it passes in front of Ilio Phosphol have lead to the discovery of a ring system around Ollo. Further study of these rings by observing stellar occultations at greatest elongation resulted in a special surprise: the discovery of a satellite mixed in with Ollo's rings, at a similar distance to Olu. If it indeed exists, it would likely be composed primarily of "ring fluff," and its low density would result in a greatly elongated shape. Further studies are required to confirm its existence by examining its gravitational impact on the rings, or simply by searching for it directly with a larger telescope with an adequate shade. Or, you know, you could visit Ollo with a spacecraft.\n\n <color=#cfcc17>-SnailsAttack</color>
