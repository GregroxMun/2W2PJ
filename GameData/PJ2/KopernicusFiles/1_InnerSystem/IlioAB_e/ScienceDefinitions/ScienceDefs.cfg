		SomnaSrfLandedMare = A simple scoop of the surface is rather dusty due to micrometeorite impacts... perhaps you need to dig a bit deeper.

		GerroInSpaceHigh = Gerro's bright enough to leave a glare when you turn toward it, and its rings only help to keep it even brighter. 
		GerroInSpaceLow = You may find yourself close to a rather large planet, wondering how it got so much bigger than Sandevistan despite only slightly more massive.
		GerroFlyingHigh = It's a noticeable drag, but it's decent enough for a short braking pass if you're at the right altitude...

		GerroFlyingLow = You probably aren't coming back from this, but it's a beautiful demise regardless.
		GerroFlyingLowLifeBand = There's a greenish tint to this that's unmistakable, but you can't always put your finger on it.
		
		SomnaInSpaceHigh = Something subtle around the moon brings to mind planets from science fiction films. You can't put your finger on it, but it looks oddly geometric.
		SomnaInSpaceHigh = Looking at Gerro and Sandevistan from this moon brings you a feeling you haven't felt that often.
		SomnaInSpaceLow = Ah! That's what they are. They're rings...
		SomnaInSpaceLow = You look at this two-toned moon and wonder what brought it all to this state...
		SomnaSrfLanded = Seeing Gerro above you like this, let alone occasional passes by Sandevistan, is rather intriguing, to say the least.

		GerroInSpaceLowEquator = The blue begins to look somewhat green at certain spots, but it could be a trick of the light.
		GerroInSpaceLowLifeBand = Subtle hints of green come around as you pass over the main central band, and you wonder how they could evolve to be like that.
		GerroFlyingHigh = Letting go of your craft, you see all the white and blue clouds passing over you.
		GerroFlyingHighLifeBand = The green is starting to become more saturated as you go down, but it's hard not to handle it.

		GerroSrfLanded = You have managed the impossible, haven't you?
				
		SomnaSrfLanded = You take a moment to look at the rings above you... Gerro and Sandevistan complementing each other in the sky... it's rather quaint, somehow.

		GerroInSpaceHigh = As predicted, the clouds are primarily water vapor, though something appears to match a thin band in the equator.
		GerroInSpaceLow = Water vapor, hints of methane bubbling up. Oddly deficient in ammonia. But... why does that equatorial band match the leaf sent aboard? ...Or did it just fry due to radiation poisoning?
		GerroFlying = The samples get blasted away due to the atmosphere, some of which catching fire, some dissolving, some simply remaining inert and getting a bit wet.
		
		SomnaSrfLanded = The glittering water ice appears to have the same reflection as Somna's northern hemisphere.

		GerroFlyingHigh = The temperature appears to be decreasing as you reach further into the atmosphere, as expected for a place like this.
		GerroFlyingLow = Temperature is slowly increasing, to the point that the clouds seem to be a bit more expansive than originally thought.
		
		SomnaInSpaceLow = Passing over the dark areas, it feels warmer than the light areas. Expected for albedo variations, but the value is actually higher than would be thought.
		SomnaSrfLanded = The whole surface seems to be hotter than expected. Something must be churning inside, and the ice appears to be almost sublimating.
		SomnaSrfLandedVolcano = There appears to be a bit of heat coming out of here, but it's hard to tell what gases are exactly being removed from here.

	@RESULTS
	{
		GerroInSpaceHigh = Gerro appears to have a lower surface gravity than Sandevistan, perhaps due to its lower density.
		GerroInSpaceHigh = Gerro seems to have a relatively thin atmosphere, like its core is mostly made up of rock and metal like Sandevistan is.
		GerroInSpaceLow = Sandevistan might be a better gravity assist target, but Gerro can still pack a punch with a close-enough flyby.
		GerroInSpaceLow = Passing through the ring plane, a negative graviolo or two comes from the rings, though it's minimal compared to the force of Somna or Sandevistan, let alone the overwhelming gravioli coming from Gerro itself.
		GerroFlyingHigh = It's a surprise that the atmospheric pressure isn't ruining the gravioli readings.
		GerroFlyingLow = The gravity seems greater than it should be for a planet of that size, but given that it exists in a tango with something as huge as Sandevistan it makes sense that this could be rather rocky.
		GerroSrfLanded = If the atmosphere didn't slather the detector with gravioli, the polyp preparing to eat this sure will.
		
		SomnaInSpaceHigh = Somna seems to be of the average density for a ball of its size. It seems to be a mixture of ice and rock, though whether it is differentiated remains to be seen.
		SomnaInSpaceHigh = When passing over the equator, a subtle band of gravioli appears to be detected. Perhaps these could be the beginnings of an equatorial ridge.
		SomnaInSpaceLow = The detector sees more negative gravioli coming from the darker regions than the brighter icy regions. This appears to suggest a body that's not fully differentiated, as if an icy moon could have molded itself onto Somna like a hood. But that's not really possible, is it?
		SomnaSrfLanded = Despite its low gravity, somehow it manages to hold onto rings.

		GerroFlyingHigh = A smattering of hydrogen and helium, but the spectrum still shows primarily water vapor.

		GerroFlyingLow = Water vapor now dominates the spectrum, although methane and ammonia still prop up from here to there.
		GerroFlyingLowStorms = Water vapor is basically all that is found here.
		GerroFlyingLowSpadeStorm = High methane content here, about half and half with water vapor.
		GerroFlyingLowLifeBand = There seems to be a marked decline in carbon dioxide content around here, and a corresponding increase in atmospheric oxygen.
		GerroSrfLanded = The atmospheric pressure is so crushing that it's now a lump of metal--no wait, it just got eaten by a jellyfish.
