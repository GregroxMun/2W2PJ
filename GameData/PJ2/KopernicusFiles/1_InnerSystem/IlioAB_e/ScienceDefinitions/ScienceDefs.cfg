		SomnaSrfLanded = The samples of this surface seem rather icy, like you're picking it off.
		SomnaSrfLandedMare = While it's tough, chipping away at this rock reveals something shiny, like obsidian.
		SomnaSrfLandedMare = A simple scoop of the surface is rather dusty due to micrometeorite impacts... perhaps you need to dig a bit deeper.
		SomnaSrfLandedVolcano = The ice here seems rather fresh, yet rocky. It's like powdered snow.
		SomnaSrfLandedHighlands = There's a coating of ice here that seems strange, until you dig deep enough and find some basaltic rock.
		SomnaSrfLandedLowlands = It's pretty much dusty rock here, seemingly basaltic.

		GerroInSpaceHigh = Gerro's bright enough to leave a glare when you turn toward it.
		GerroInSpaceLow = You may find yourself close to a rather large planet, wondering how it got so much bigger than Sandevistan despite being the less massive of the two.
		GerroFlyingHigh = It's a noticeable drag, but it's decent enough for a short braking pass if you're at the right altitude...
		GerroFlyingLow = You probably aren't coming back from this, but it's a beautiful demise regardless.
		GerroFlyingLowLifeBand = There's a greenish tint to this that's unmistakable, but you can't always put your finger on it.
		
		SomnaInSpaceHigh = Something subtle around the moon brings to mind planets from science fiction films. You can't put your finger on it, but it looks oddly geometric.
		SomnaInSpaceHigh = Looking at Gerro and Sandevistan from this moon brings you a feeling you haven't felt that often.
		SomnaInSpaceLow = Ah! That's what they are. They're rings...
		SomnaInSpaceLow = You look at this two-toned moon and wonder what brought it all to this state...

		GerroInSpaceLowSpadeStorm = The atmospheric flummery going on here is ridiculous, but beautiful.
		GerroInSpaceLowEquator = The blue begins to look somewhat green at certain spots, but it could be a trick of the light.
		GerroInSpaceLowLifeBand = Subtle hints of green come around as you pass over the main central band, and you wonder how they could evolve to be like that.
		GerroFlyingHigh = Letting go of your craft, you see all the white and blue clouds passing over you.
		GerroFlyingHighLifeBand = The green is starting to become more saturated as you go down, but it's hard not to handle it.
		GerroFlyingLow = It's a massive undertaking here, but falling down you still feel oddly buoyant.
		GerroFlyingLowStorms = You get picked up by the wind, but it's not hard to feel such a release upon doing so.
		GerroFlyingLowLifeBand = It's overcome by green now... and it's beautiful.
